<H2>The PC64 cable</H2>
(using with SIDPlay for Windows)
</CENTER>

<H3>Usage</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Don't get the latest SIDPlay for Windows because its
<A HREF="pc64.html">PC64 cable</A> support is broken. Get the older
<A HREF="winprg.html#sidplay_old">SIDPlay for Windows 2000-04-10</A> release
instead.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Make sure that the parallel port, you want to plug your
PC64 cable into, is configured to the port address $0378 because SIDPlay can't
use a parallel port at any different address. If needed, rejumper the port
&ndash; for older I/O-controller cards and parallel port cards &ndash; or enter
the BIOS setup and change the address in the "Integrated peripherals" menu
&ndash; for newer, integrated controllers.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alternatively, under Windows 95/98, launch the "System"
icon of the Windows Control Panel, go to the "Device Manager" tab, open the
"Ports (COM &amp; LPT)" tree, select the appropriate "Printer Port" and press
"Properties". In the property sheet, go to the "Resources" tab, uncheck "Use
automatic settings" and select that item from the "Setting based on" list
which shows "0378-037F" as "Input/Output Range". Press OK. Beware, as the
warning also says, disabling the automatic settings may cause conflicts either
right away or in the future, when you plug a new card into your PC.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Launch SIDPlay and configure it for your needs. Remember to
enter the "Settings"/"Device" menu and select the "Commodore 64" output
device. To its right, select "PC64" from the "Type of connection" list. Exit
SIDPlay.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Extract "sidloader_pc64.prg" from the SIDPlay distribution
package and copy it onto a Commodore disk or tape.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Switch your Commodore machine off. Connect the user port
plug of the PC64 cable onto the user port of your Commodore machine, being
very careful not to do it upside down, otherwise you may kill your PC parallel
port within a second. Connect the parallel plug into the parallel port of your
PC.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Switch your Commodore machine back on, load
"sidloader_pc64.prg", and run it. You will see a blank grey screen. Don't
start the program if SIDPlay is already running.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Launch SIDPlay again. The Commodore's screen will show
stripes for a split second, while the player is being uploaded to the
Commodore, and then become black.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In SIDPlay, select the music you want to load. Beware, not
all musics can be played on a real C64. In particular, digital samples don't
work and, if the music data overwrites the player, the Commodore will lock
up.</P>
