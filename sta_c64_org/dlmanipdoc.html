<CENTER><H2>Drive Letter Manipulator</H2></CENTER>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This software has been designed to list drive letter assignments to physical
disk drives and hard disk partitions and to manipulate these assignments. Its
main purpose is to restore drive letters when they get shifted after the
installation of other hard disks, e.g. ones in hard disk racks. The drive
letter changes, when made early enough upon the startup of DOS mode, are also
visible in Windows 95/98/ME.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">WARNING: It is important that all your DOS drives must have non-empty unique
volume labels for this software to operate correctly.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NOTE: In this documentation, Windows means Windows 95/98/ME. In Windows
NT/2000/XP, you can use the Disk Administrator, Disk Management or a similar
utility of the Control Panel to assign drive letters anyway so this software
is not needed.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CREDIT: Some ideas, data consistency checks and error messages in this
software have been taken from the reverse engineering of DrvOrder (&copy; by
unknown, 2000).</P>

<H3><A NAME="section1">1. Usage</A></H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before using the software for the first time, see the next section for
important notes.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The software comes in two flavors. You can use the executable version, with
COM extension, of the software from the command line or AUTOEXEC.BAT:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">DLMANIP [-|/&lt;options&gt;] &lt;command&gt; [&lt;parameters&gt;...]</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alternatively, you can use the driver version, with SYS extension, from
CONFIG.SYS:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">DEVICE=&lt;path&gt;\DLMANIP.SYS [-|/&lt;options&gt;] &lt;command&gt; [&lt;parameters...&gt;]</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If parameters contain spaces, enclose them into quotation marks. In drive
letters, you may append the colon, if you like.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you install device drivers, from drives whose letter needs to be changed,
in CONFIG.SYS then load the driver version of the software from CONFIG.SYS
beforehands. Note that you have to specify the full name of the driver,
including its path: at that point, the PATH environment variable is not
defined yet so DOS cannot find the file automatically.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Note that the driver is not a real device driver: it does not install itself
anywhere and it returns all the memory to DOS when it has finished processing
the command specified.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Commands:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LIST</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lists the current drive letter assignments:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&lt;drive letter&gt;Tab&lt;partition name&gt;Tab&lt;volume label&gt;Tab&lt;serial number&gt;</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The partition name follows a Linux-style naming convention (see below).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The syntax for &lt;serial number&gt; is "####-####" where "#" represents a
hexadecimal digit.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SET &lt;letter&gt; &lt;partition name&gt; &lt;volume label&gt; &lt;serial number&gt;</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moves the drive, that is situated on the specified partition and has the
specified volume label and serial number, to &lt;letter&gt;. The letter of the
previous drive &lt;letter&gt; becomes undefined and is later replaced by the
first available letter.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The partition name follows a Linux-style naming convention (see below).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The syntax for &lt;serial number&gt; is "####-####" where "#" represents a
hexadecimal digit.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Special values for &lt;letter&gt; are:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">-: Delete the drive letter. The drive will not be available anymore.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*: Auto assign the drive letter. The drive will be assigned the first
available letter.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A special value for &lt;partition name&gt;, &lt;volume label&gt; and &lt;serial number&gt;
is "*" which matches any partition, volume label or serial number: e.g. if
you want to search for a volume label only, specify "*" for both the
partition name and the serial number.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To see the current settings of all drives, use the "LIST" command.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">MOVE &lt;source letter&gt; &lt;destination letter&gt;</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moves the drive &lt;source letter&gt; to &lt;destination letter&gt;. The letter of the
original drive &lt;destination letter&gt; becomes undefined and is later
replaced by the first available letter.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">DELETE &lt;letter&gt;</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Deletes the drive &lt;letter&gt;. The drive will not be available anymore and
its letter may be reused for other drives.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SWAP &lt;letter #1&gt; &lt;letter #2&gt;</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Swaps the letters of two drives, &lt;letter #1&gt; and &lt;letter #2&gt;.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">REASSIGN &lt;number of main hard disks&gt;</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reassigns letters, using the original DOS algorithm, to all drives.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You have to specify the number of hard disks to which letters from the
beginning of the alphabet are to be assigned. When all the partitions of
this many hard disks got a letter, then and only then does the software
advance to subsequent hard disks and assigns letters to their partitions,
as well.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Options:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Q: Makes the software operate quietly. Beware, in this mode, not even
error messages are displayed.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The original DOS algorithm starts the assignment of hard disk partitions
with the drive letter C:, independently of the number of floppy disk drives
installed. It processes only those partitions whose type it recognizes - for
DOS 3.x and above versions: FAT12 and FAT16; for DOS 7.x versions in Windows
95 OSR2 and Windows 98: FAT32, as well - and skips partitions of all other
types - including but not limited to HPFS/NTFS, Linux native, Linux swap etc.
Its main steps are the following:</P>

<OL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Process the first primary partition of all hard disks.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Start at first hard disk and see if it has a primary partition. If so,
assign a drive letter to the first such primary partition (the one with
the lowest partition number).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Do the same with the next hard disk and continue until reaching the last
hard disk.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Process all logical partitions of all hard disks.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Start at first hard disk and see if it has an extended partition. (There
may only be a single extended partition, if any, on each hard disk). If
so, traverse through it and assign subsequent drive letters to each
logical drive, in the order they are defined in the extended partition.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Do the same with the next hard disk and continue until reaching the last
hard disk.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Process further primary partitions of all hard disks.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Start at first hard disk and see if it has more than one primary
partition. If so, assign a drive letter to them, in the order of their
definition in the Master Boot Record. Make sure to skip the first primary
partition as a drive letter has already been assigned to it in step 1.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Do the same with the next hard disk and continue until reaching the last
hard disk.</P>
</OL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Linux uses a significantly simpler algorithm. All partitions on all hard
disks are processed, even if their type is not recognized. Its main steps are
the following.</P>

<OL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The two floppy disk drives are named "fd0" (usually A: under DOS/Windows)
and "fd1" (usually B:). If more floppy disk drives are installed, they
get subsequent numbers after the "fd" prefix.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">IDE hard disks are named "hda", "hdb", "hdc" etc. Note that, unlike with
DOS/Windows, these names do not change if other hard disks installed. The
master hard disk on the primary IDE channel is always "hda"; the primary
slave is always "hdb"; the secondary master is "hdc"; the secondary slave
is "hdd" etc.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SCSI hard disks are names "sda", "sdb", "sdc" etc., in a similar manner.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Primary and extended partitions, those defined in the Master Boot Record,
are numbered from 1 to 4, thus are named "xdx1" to "xdx4" where "xdx" is
the name assigned to their parent hard disk in step 2. Yes, even extended
partitions have a name, although they cannot be used to store data.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If an extended partition exists, its logical drives are numbered from 5
upwards, in the order they were defined in the extended partition.</P>
</OL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This software uses a similar algorithm for assigning names to partitions.
The "LIST" command includes these partition names in its output:</P>

<OL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first device that the BIOS recognizes as an IDE hard disk, SCSI hard
disk or equivalent is named "hda"; the second is named "hdb" etc.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This device may also be an IDE/SCSI CD-ROM or DVD-ROM or a USB/Firewire
hard disk, CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, flash drive or pen drive etc., if your BIOS
supports accessing such devices - and, perhaps, can even boot from them.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For this reason, unlike under Linux, "hda" is not necessarily the master
hard disk on the primary IDE channel. Also, holes between IDE devices are
not taken into account by the BIOS: e.g if the primary master is present,
the primary slave is missing, and the secondary master is present then
the secondary master will be named "hdb", not "hdc" as Linux would name
it. This is a limitation of the BIOS, not this software.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Partitions are numbered the same way as under Linux (see above).</P>
</OL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An example for drive letters shifting after the installation of another hard
disk and the "REASSIGN" command taking care of it. You have two hard disks
installed all the time, each have one primary partition and two logical
drives. DOS assigns drive letters as the following:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">C: First hard disk, primary partition<BR>
D: Second hard disk, primary partition<BR>
E: First hard disk, first logical drive<BR>
F: First hard disk, second logical drive<BR>
G: Second hard disk, first logical drive<BR>
H: Second hard disk, second logical drive</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now install a third hard disk, with one primary partition and two logical
drives on it. The result is:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">C: First hard disk, primary partition<BR>
D: Second hard disk, primary partition<BR>
E: Third hard disk, primary partition<BR>
F: First hard disk, first logical drive<BR>
G: First hard disk, second logical drive<BR>
H: Second hard disk, first logical drive<BR>
I: Second hard disk, second logical drive<BR>
J: Third hard disk, first logical drive<BR>
K: Third hard disk, second logical drive</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As you can see, the logical drives of the two main hard disks had their
letters shifted. Now use the "REASSIGN 2" command and you get:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">C: First hard disk, primary partition<BR>
D: Second hard disk, primary partition<BR>
E: First hard disk, first logical drive<BR>
F: First hard disk, second logical drive<BR>
G: Second hard disk, first logical drive<BR>
H: Second hard disk, second logical drive<BR>
I: Third hard disk, primary partition<BR>
J: Third hard disk, first logical drive<BR>
K: Third hard disk, second logical drive</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is the original drive letter assignment plus letters from the end of
the alphabet have been assigned to the partitions of the third hard disk. For
the "REASSIGN 1" command, you get:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">C: First hard disk, primary partition<BR>
D: First hard disk, first logical drive<BR>
E: First hard disk, second logical drive<BR>
F: Second hard disk, primary partition<BR>
G: Third hard disk, primary partition<BR>
H: Second hard disk, first logical drive<BR>
I: Second hard disk, second logical drive<BR>
J: Third hard disk, first logical drive<BR>
K: Third hard disk, second logical drive</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Note that the letter D: is not assigned to the primary partition of the
second hard disk anymore because you specified that you have only one main
hard disk.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Drive letter manipulations also work under the DOS mode of Windows. If you
launch Windows afterwards, the new drive letter assignments will be visible
there, too. However, read below if you want to change the letter of the system
partition.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Special note for Windows users! If your operating system is installed onto a
partition whose drive letter has been changed, you may run into one or more of
the following errors while Windows is being loaded:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Symptom: Error message "Registry file was not found. Registry services may
be inoperative for this session." displayed while loading. If you let
Windows continue loading, the result will be a disaster: as no system
configuration can be read from the registry, all settings fall back to
default, similarly to safe mode or as if running Windows for the very
first time, right after its installation.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reason: DOS mode seems to internally store the drive letter of the system
partition, after having finished processing CONFIG.SYS so changing the
drive letter in AUTOEXEC.BAT or from the command line is too late. The
message means that the registry file has not been loaded because DOS could
not find it.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Solution: The drive letters have to be changed in CONFIG.SYS. You have to
use the "DEVICE=" command in CONFIG.SYS to load the device version of the
software.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Symptom: Error message "XMS cache problem. Registry services may be
inoperative for this session." displayed while loading.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reason: DOS mode installs HIMEM.SYS, from the system partition, invisibly
and automatically, before it starts processing CONFIG.SYS. The message
means that HIMEM.SYS has not been loaded because DOS could not find it.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Solution: Load HIMEM.SYS explicitly in CONFIG.SYS, using the correct path.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Symptom: Loading aborts, fatal error "[VFAT Device Initialization Failed]
A device or resource required by VFAT is not present or is unavailable.
VFAT cannot continue loading. System halted." displayed on a blue screen.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reason: DOS mode installs IFSHLP.SYS, from the system partition, invisibly
and automatically, before it starts processing CONFIG.SYS. The message
means that IFSHLP.SYS has not been loaded because DOS could not find it.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Solution: Load IFSHLP.SYS explicitly in CONFIG.SYS, using the correct
path.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If your Windows ran fine before then these problems are, most probably, all
related to DOS and Windows getting confused about the drive letter of the
system partition being different from what it expects.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A suggested solution for all of the problems above is the following. First,
copy the driver version of this software into a directory on a drive whose
letter is never going to change ("C:\WINBOOT" in the example) - obviously, the
best candidate for this is a directory on drive C:. Also copy HIMEM.SYS and
IFSHLP.SYS from the Windows directory into this directory. Then prepend the
following lines to your CONFIG.SYS:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">DEVICE=C:\WINBOOT\DLMANIP.SYS /Q &lt;command&gt; &lt;parameters...&gt;<BR>
DEVICE=C:\WINBOOT\HIMEM.SYS<BR>
DEVICE=C:\WINBOOT\IFSHLP.SYS<BR>
[...]</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first line fixes drive letters. The second and third lines explicitly
install the otherwise invisibly and automatically installed system drivers.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Use the letter manipulation commands of this software to change the drive
letters, before letting DOS process the rest of CONFIG.SYS. Remember, these
must be the first lines of your CONFIG.SYS.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If there are some other drivers that you install from the Windows directory
in CONFIG.SYS then make a copy of those, too, and change your CONFIG.SYS
accordingly. For example, to install country and code page settings:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">[...]<BR>
COUNTRY=&lt;country&gt;,&lt;code page&gt;,C:\WINBOOT\COUNTRY.SYS<BR>
DEVICE=C:\WINBOOT\DISPLAY.SYS CON=(EGA,,1)<BR>
[...]</P>

<H3><A NAME="section2">2. Important notes</A></H3>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The software can only list and manipulate drive letters the underlying
BIOS and DOS have already recognized upon booting up.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The software refuses to work when a disk cache is present as drive letter
changes may make the cache read/write data from/to the wrong drive.
Changes are not permitted under Windows either, for similar reasons, only
in DOS mode.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Make sure to have unique volume labels and serial numbers for all your
drives! Not only this software needs that but many others, too.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because the software deals with very delicate matters, make sure that it
is the first software executed upon the boot process. If you use software
that create drives (disk devices) - including but not limited to CD/DVD
drives, SCSI drives, RAID drives, USB drives, Firewire drives, network
drives, RAM disks, compressed drives, SUBST'ed, JOIN'ed, ASSIGN'ed drives
- then change the drive letters with this software before loading the disk
device drivers, otherwise those drivers may get confused.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After any change, the "number of block devices installed" value is updated
in a DOS internal table to the highest drive letter available at that
moment. Otherwise, the directory structure of drives, whose letter is
above this value, may not be completely visible: only the first file or
directory in the root directory is returned. This is due to an intentional
internal DOS feature that is assumed have been implemented to speed up
access to disk drives.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a result of the update, the "number of block devices installed" value
may be higher than the actual number of block devices, that is, disk
drives installed and this may confuse some disk device drivers. Depending
on the smartness of the disk device driver, you may or may not have
problems with installing new drives to (unused) letters that are below the
highest drive letter but above the "number of block devices installed"
value. As a special case, after having moved a drive to the highest
possible letter Z:, seeing the "number of block devices installed" value
set to the equivalent of Z:, some (not so smart) device drivers may
believe that there are no more drive letters available and refuse
installation.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Copying drive letters, that is, assigning multiple letters to the same
drive is not possible as the result would be identical to the one above:
only the first entry of the root directory is visible on the clone drives.
Instead of this software, use the SUBST or ASSIGN commands of DOS.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The DOS mode of Windows has serious problems with handling partitions that
are very large (usually FAT32 partitions) and/or are beyond some BIOS hard
disk size limit. As a result, the DOS mode recognizes the partition and
assigns a letter to it but shows garbage instead of the partition contents
or returns an error saying that the drive is invalid or unformatted.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Beware, even if the partition contents seem to be fine, you may destroy
data in other partitions if you write onto such strange drives! Your best
choice is to delete them, with the "DELETE" command of this software, so
that they are not available in DOS mode. When the Windows GUI boots up, it
will recognize the partitions (again), assign letters to them (again) and
handle their contents properly.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You will get the "Drive letter beyond LASTDRIVE value" error if you try to
move a drive to an unavailable letter. E.g. if your LASTDRIVE is set to G,
you will not be able to use the letters H: to Z: for any drive.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also important to know that while CONFIG.SYS is being processed,
the LASTDRIVE value does not change. E.g. if you have altogether five DOS
partitions on your hard disks, the device driver version of this software
will see a LASTDRIVE value of G. Unfortunately, not even placing a
"LASTDRIVE=Z" line before the call to the device driver helps with this:
the LASTDRIVE value changes only after CONFIG.SYS has been processed
completely.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For this reason, you cannot move drives to letters at the end of the
alphabet from CONFIG.SYS - in the example above, from H: to Z: -, this is
possible only from AUTOEXEC.BAT, with the executable version of the
software, after having raised the LASTDRIVE value in CONFIG.SYS. This is a
limitation of DOS, not this software.</P>
