</CENTER>

<H3>Description</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The <B>XA1541 active cable</B> is a serial cable that
connects Commodore machines or drives to the PC parallel port. It's a
substitute for the <A HREF="x1541.html">X1541 cable</A>,
<A HREF="xe1541.html">XE1541 extended cable</A> and
<A HREF="xm1541.html">XM1541 multitask cable</A> and has been designed to work
in all modes of all parallel ports on all PC motherboards. It's compatible
with all parallel ports and with all Commodore machines and drives and clones
 that have the usual serial bus port.</P>

<H3>Hardware requirements</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You need the following hardware to make use of this
cable:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A PC with a parallel port</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Commodore 64, 128 or VIC20 machine or a Commodore
  1541, 1570, 1571 or 1581 drive, or any other Commodore machine or drive or
  clone that has the usual serial bus port</P>
</UL>

<H3>Software support</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The cable is supported by the following PC software:</P>

<H3>Important notes</H3>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Don't let the name "XA1541" fool you. This cable works
  with all kinds of Commodore drives that have the usual serial bus port, not
  only Commodore 1541 drives. Also, you can use it to connect a Commodore
  machine to the PC.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If your Commodore 1541, 1570 or 1571 drive is already
  fitted with a <A HREF="cbmpar.html">Commodore parallel cable</A> then you
  might be better off with the <A HREF="xap1541a.html">XAP1541 adaptor</A>
  which makes use of the parallel cable and triples the transfer speed.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This cable should be working with those motherboards
  and laptops, as well, that are incompatible with the
  <A HREF="xe1541.html">XE1541 extended cable</A> and the
  <A HREF="xm1541.html">XM1541 multitask cable</A>. However, because those two
  cables are easier to build and they do work with most present PC's, it is
  suggested that you build this cable only if you know that your motherboard
  doesn't support those cables or you want to prepare for the future when,
  possibly, further incompatible motherboards will appear on the market.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Currently, the following motherboard revisions are
  known to not support this cable:</P>

  <UL>
  <LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
   <A HREF="http://tw.giga-byte.com/Products/Motherboard/Products_Spec.aspx?ProductID=1578">Gigabyte
     GA-5AX, revision 3.0</A> (not available anymore)</P>
  </UL>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Please, note that these motherboard revisions don't
  support <U>any</U> of <A HREF="xcables.html">the X1541-series cables</A>:
  apparently, they don't follow the parallel port specifications correctly. If
  you have access to any of these motherboard revisions, please, do some tests
  and send your results to me. New items will be added to this list as proven
  negative feedback is left.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This cable uses BSV52 transistors which are very small
  SMD components; this makes the construction quite troublesome. If you want
  to take the risk, you may use 2N3904 transistors instead but, be warned,
  there's no guarantee that a cable with that transistor would work on any
  PC.</P>
</UL>

<H3>Construction</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Method 1.</B> If you can't or don't want to put the
electronical parts onto a small board, you may solder them together with
simple wiring. You can find the details on how to build this cable at the
<A HREF="xa1541c.html">construction page</A>.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Method 2.</B> A more reliable and elegant solution is to
put the complete circuitry onto a small board and hide it inside the case of
the parallel plug. You can find the details on how to build the cable, with
this board, at the <A HREF="xa1541c2.html">construction page</A>.</P>

<H3>Pictures</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The assembled cable for Method 2 looks like this:
<A HREF="pccbmgenser.jpg">complete cable</A>, <A HREF="xa1541partop.jpg">top
of parallel plug at PC end</A>, <A HREF="xa1541parbot.jpg">bottom of parallel
plug at PC end</A>, <A HREF="cbmgenserdin.jpg">DIN plug at Commodore
end</A>.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These pictures should give you an overall idea on how the
cable looks like and how it should be properly assembled. However, when
building a cable yourself, you should not rely on the pictures only; see the
construction guides instead.</P>

<H3>Usage</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Connect the serial plug into the serial port of your
Commodore drive. Connect the parallel plug into the parallel port of your
PC.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Important!</B> Do not plug or unplug cables while your
equipment is switched on. Make sure that all components of your equipment are
connected to the same, properly grounded power outlet. Put your equipment far
away from monitors, TV sets and other devices with strong emission, otherwise
cables may pick up interference and you may experience data loss or
corruption.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you have problems with your cable then you can test it
with <A HREF="scextprg.html#xctest">XCTest</A> and
<A HREF="scextprg.html#xcdetect">XCDetect</A>.</P>
