<H3>Description</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The <B>X1531 cable</B> connects Commodore 1531 datasettes,
those of Commodore 16 and Plus 4 machines, to the PC parallel port. It's
compatible with all kinds of parallel ports and with Commodore 1531 datasettes
and compatible clones.</P>

<H3>Hardware requirements</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You need the following hardware to make use of this
cable:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A PC with a parallel port</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Commodore 1531 datasette or clone</P>
</UL>

<H3>Important notes</H3>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This cable needs 5 V power for operation. For a power
  supply, the PC game port was chosen. You should <U>not</U> use the keyboard
  port or a USB port as these ports are not designed to provide enough power
  for the motor of the datasette: the datasette may or may not work but, in
  the worst case, you may even kill the port or the motherboard.</P>
</UL>

<H3>Construction</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You can find the details on how to build this cable at the
<A HREF="x1531c.html">construction page</A>.</P>

<H3>Pictures</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The assembled cable looks like this:

plug at PC end</A>, <A HREF="x1531pwrgam.jpg">game port plug at PC end</A>,
<A HREF="x1531din.jpg">mini-DIN plug at Commodore end</A>.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These pictures should give you an overall idea on how the
cable looks like and how it should be properly assembled. However, when
building a cable yourself, you should not rely on the pictures only; see the
construction guide instead.</P>

<H3>Usage</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Connect the mini-DIN plug into your Commodore datasette.
Connect the game port plug into the game port of your PC. Connect the parallel
plug into the parallel port of your PC.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Important!</B> Do not plug or unplug cables while your
equipment is switched on. Make sure that all components of your equipment are
connected to the same, properly grounded power outlet. Put your equipment far
away from monitors, TV sets and other devices with strong emission, otherwise
cables may pick up interference and you may experience data loss or
corruption.</P>
