</CENTER>

<H3>Description</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The <B>XMP1541 cable combo</B> is a Y-shaped cable that is,
actually, a pair of an <A HREF="xm1541.html">XM1541 multitask cable</A> and an
<A HREF="xp1541.html">XP1541 or XP1571 parallel cable</A>. It's compatible
with <A HREF="parport.html">PS/2</A>, <A HREF="parport.html">EPP</A> and
<A HREF="parport.html">ECP</A> parallel ports and with Commodore 1541, 1570
and 1571 drives.</P>

<H3>Hardware requirements</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You need the following hardware to make use of this
cable:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A PC with a <A HREF="parport.html">PS/2</A>,
  <A HREF="parport.html">EPP</A> or <A HREF="parport.html">ECP</A> parallel
  port</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Commodore 1541, 1570 or 1571 drive or compatible
  clone; for a serial connection only, any Commodore drive or clone, that has
  the usual serial bus port, will do</P>
</UL>

<H3>Software support</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The cable is fully supported by the following PC
software:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the list of software partially supporting this cable,
see the page of the <A HREF="xm1541.html">XM1541 multitask cable</A> and the

<H3>Important notes</H3>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Don't let the name "XMP1541" fool you. The serial half
  of this cable works with all kinds of Commodore drives that have the usual
  serial bus port, not only Commodore 1541 drives. And the parallel half of
  the cable works with Commodore 1570 and 1571 drives, as well.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you already have a <A HREF="cbmpar.html">Commodore
  parallel cable</A> then you might want to build the
  <A HREF="xmp1541a.html">XMP1541 adaptor</A> instead.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have found this cable to fail to work with certain
  motherboards, including ones with the <B>ALI 5</B> chipset and some laptops.
  Check your motherboard's manual or visit the manufacturer's homepage before
  trying this cable. If your PC proves to be incompatible with this cable then
  use the <A HREF="xap1541.html">XAP1541 cable combo</A> instead.</P>
</UL>

<H3>Construction</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You can find the details on how to build this cable at the
<A HREF="xmp1541c.html">construction page</A>.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you already have an <A HREF="xm1541.html">XM1541
multitask cable</A> then you can find the details on how to transform it at
the <A HREF="xmp1541c2.html">construction page</A>.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you already have an <A HREF="xep1541.html">XEP1541 cable
combo</A> then you can find the details on how to transform it at the
<A HREF="xmp1541c3.html">construction page</A>.</P>

<H3>Usage</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Connect the serial plug into the serial port on your
Commodore drive. Connect the parallel plug into the parallel port on your
Commodore drive. Connect the PC parallel plug into the parallel port of your
PC.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Important!</B> Do not plug or unplug cables while your
equipment is switched on. Make sure that all components of your equipment are
connected to the same, properly grounded power outlet. Put your equipment far
away from monitors, TV sets and other devices with strong emission, otherwise
cables may pick up interference and you may experience data loss or
corruption. Never leave the parallel half of the cable connected alone, only
if the serial half is also connected, otherwise the lack of GND connection may
severely damage your equipment.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you have problems with your cable then you can test it
with <A HREF="scextprg.html#xctest">XCTest</A> and
<A HREF="scextprg.html#xcdetect">XCDetect</A>.</P>
