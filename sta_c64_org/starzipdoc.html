<CENTER><H2>Star Zip</H2></CENTER>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This program was designed to zip and unzip disk images using the ZipCode
algorithm. It can create and extract both diskpacked and filepacked ZipCode
archives. Sixpacked archives and GCR-coded disk images are not supported.
Star Zip is an external utility of The Star Commander but is also distributed
separately.</P>

<PRE>
   STARZIP [-]A &lt;diskname&gt; [-|/C|D|Ixxyy|S|Y] [&lt;zipname&gt;] 
   STARZIP [-]F &lt;diskname&gt; [-|/C|D|Y] [&lt;zipname&gt;] 
STARZIP [-]L &lt;zipname&gt;
STARZIP [-]T &lt;zipname&gt;
   STARZIP [-]X &lt;zipname&gt; [-|/4|7|8|C|D|X[D|P|S]|Y] [&lt;diskname&gt;]

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Commands:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A: Zips disk images into diskpacked ZipCode archives. (Add)</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">F: Zips disk images into filepacked ZipCode archives. (Filepack)</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">L: Lists the contents of filepacked ZipCode archives. (List)</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">T: Tests the integrity of diskpacked ZipCode archives. (Test)</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">X: Unzips both types of ZipCode archives into disk images. (eXtract)</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&lt;diskname&gt;:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Type the path and the name of the disk images here (the extension is always
".d64" for 1541, ".d71" for 1571 and ".d81" for 1581 disk images). If you
leave this parameter blank when unzipping, the name of the disk image will be
determined by stripping the first two characters off of the name of the
ZipCode archive. You can use wildcards to add multiple disk images and you can
use long filenames, too.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&lt;zipname&gt;:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Type the path, the base name and the extension of the ZipCode archive here
(the default extension for ZipCode archives is empty). Leave this parameter
blank and the base names of the archives will be the names of the original
disk images. However, the names of diskpacked ZipCode archives have the
structure "&lt;number-of-part&gt;!&lt;basename&gt;.&lt;extension&gt;" and for filepacked ZipCode
archives it is "&lt;letter-code-of-part&gt;!&lt;basename&gt;.&lt;extension&gt;". You can use
wildcards to list, test or extract multiple archives and you can use long
filenames, too.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Options:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4: Extracts filepacked data into 1541 disk images (default).</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">7: Extracts filepacked data into 1571 disk images.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">8: Extracts filepacked data into 1581 disk images.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">C: Asks for your confirmation about extracting each file.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">D: Deletes successfully processed source files.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ixxyy: The second two bytes of the first diskpacked archive hold the
sector header ID of the original disk. Since there is no sector header in
disk images, this field cannot be filled automatically. Its default value
is the cosmetical ID in the BAM of the source disk image but you can
override it by entering two hexadecimal values as the argument of this
option.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">L: Displays Commodore filenames with the lowercase/uppercase character set
(default).</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">S: Stores original sector data uncompressed, good if you want to further
compress the output with an archiver.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">U: Displays Commodore filenames with the uppercase/graphics character set.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">X: Extracts data into 40-track 1541 disk images. You can choose the offset
of the additional BAM entries by adding "S" (Speed DOS, default), "D"
(Dolphin DOS) or "P" (Prologic DOS) to this option.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Y: Assumes "Yes" to all queries, good for running from batch files.</P>
