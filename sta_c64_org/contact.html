<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you wish to contact me then, please, respect my
guidelines on how to do it. If you don't adhere to some of them, you may get
no reply at all.</P>

<H3>Personal info</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Joe Forster/STA</B> is only my scene nick, my real name
is <B>Kov&aacute;cs Bal&aacute;zs</B>. Note that Hungarians, similarly to
Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese and other Eastern Asian people, have
their names in a "reverse" order. If you really don't want to call me
<B>Joe</B> then, please, use <B>Bal&aacute;zs</B> (preferred) or <B>Mr.
Kov&aacute;cs</B> in your greeting rather than the opposite.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Also, here's an old <A HREF="sta.jpg">photo</A> of
mine.</P>

<H3>E-mail</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Address:</B> My E-mail address is
<A HREF="mailto:sta@c64.rulez.org">sta@c64.rulez.org</A> (sta@c64.org has not
been working for a long time). Don't use or spread any E-mail address of mine
other than this, unless I explicitly ask you to. This E-mail address is
protected with SpamAssassin; E-mails marked as spam by the filter are deleted
automatically.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Language:</B> Please, use English or Hungarian. If you
really have to, you may use German, as well, but be warned, I only understand
it, I don't speak it.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Format:</B> I'm not using a graphical mailer software
under Windows. Send your message as plain text only, fully HTML messages
bounce back automatically.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Files:</B> I can handle attachments, uuencoded files and
even Macintosh BinHex files. Don't send uncompressed files as those will
bounce back automatically. I prefer ZIP but I can also handle most compressed
formats. If you wish to send many files to me, then, please, ask me before
you do it; I don't like being flooded with large E-mails without having been
warned.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Contents:</B> If you have questions or are reporting
problems, first, read the documentation and online help, if any, of the
software you're trying to use, or read the relevant page on this site. If you
don't succeed then include as many details as possible and, for problems, a
guide on how to reproduce them.</P>
