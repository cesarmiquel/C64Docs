<H2>The XAP1541 adaptor</H2>
</CENTER>

<H3>Description</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The <B>XAP1541 adaptor</B> serves as a pair of an
<A HREF="xa1541.html">XA1541 active cable</A> and an
<A HREF="xp1541.html">XP1541 or XP1571 parallel cable</A>, allowing you to
reuse your already existing <A HREF="cbmser.html"> Commodore serial cable</A>
and <A HREF="cbmpar.html">Commodore parallel cable</A>. It's compatible with
<A HREF="parport.html">PS/2</A>, <A HREF="parport.html">EPP</A> and
<A HREF="parport.html">ECP</A> parallel ports and with Commodore 1541, 1570
and 1571 drives.</P>

<H3>Hardware requirements</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You need the following hardware to make use of this
adaptor:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A PC with a <A HREF="parport.html">PS/2</A>,
  <A HREF="parport.html">EPP</A> or <A HREF="parport.html">ECP</A> parallel
  port</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Commodore 1541, 1570 or 1571 drive or compatible
  clone; for a serial connection only, any Commodore drive or clone, that has
  the usual serial bus port, will do</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A <A HREF="cbmser.html">Commodore serial cable</A> and
  an optional <A HREF="cbmpar.html">Commodore parallel cable</A> between the
  drive and a Commodore machine</P>
</UL>

<H3>Software support</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The adaptor is fully supported by the following PC

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the list of software partially supporting this adaptor,

<A HREF="xp1541.html">XP1541 and XP1571 parallel cables</A>.</P>

<H3>Important notes</H3>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Don't let the name "XAP1541" fool you. The serial half
  of this adaptor works with all kinds of Commodore drives that have the usual
  serial bus port, not only Commodore 1541 drives. And the parallel half of
  the adaptor works with Commodore 1570 and 1571 drives, as well.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This adaptor itself gives you no parallel capabilities.
  If your drive doesn't have it already then you should build the
  <A HREF="cbmpar.html">Commodore parallel cable</A> first. However, the
  adaptor works fine with a serial cable only, in which case you won't be able
  to use the parallel capabilities, if any, of the drive.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you don't want to use the parallel features of your
  drive from a Commodore machine then you might want to create the
  <A HREF="xap1541.html">XAP1541 cable combo</A> instead.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because of its width, it's possible that the adaptor
  will physically not fit the back of your PC because the case or other ports
  or cables are in the way. Therefore, before building it, you should have a
  look at the <A HREF="xap1541as.png">schematic diagram</A>, indicating the
  shape and size of the adaptor, in millimeters. Cut it out from paper and
  check it against the back of your PC. Be warned that, even if it does fit,
  you might still have problems connecting cables to adjacent ports when this
  adaptor is plugged into the parallel port.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unlike the user port in a real Commodore machine, this
  adaptor has no notches because those would make it too fragile. If your user
  port plug is coded, that is, it has sticks that fit into the notches of a
  real user port then this adaptor is, unfortunately, not for you.</P>
</UL>

<H3>Construction</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You can find the details on how to build this adaptor at
the <A HREF="xap1541ac.html">construction page</A>.</P>

<H3>Pictures</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The assembled adaptor looks like this:
<A HREF="xap1541top1.jpg">top from PC parallel plug side</A>,
<A HREF="xap1541top2.jpg">top from Commodore serial/parallel port side</A>,
<A HREF="xap1541bot.jpg">bottom circuitry</A>.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These pictures should give you an overall idea on how the
adaptor looks like and how it should be properly assembled. However, when
building an adaptor yourself, you should not rely on the pictures only; see
the construction guide instead.</P>

<H3>Usage</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Take your already existing <A HREF="cbmser.html">Commodore
serial cable</A>. Connect one serial plug into the serial port of your
Commodore drive and the other serial plug into the serial port of the adaptor.
Take your already existing <A HREF="cbmpar.html">Commodore parallel cable</A>.
If you have a parallel port on your Commodore drive then you can connect one
end of the cable into it; otherwise the cable is, probably, just hanging out
of the drive. Connect the user port plug onto the user port edge of the
adaptor, being very careful not to do it upside down, that is, the top side of
the user port plug should be leveled with that side of the adaptor with the
plugs. Connect the parallel plug of the adaptor into the parallel port of your
PC.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Important!</B> Do not plug or unplug cables while your
equipment is switched on. Make sure that all components of your equipment are
connected to the same, properly grounded power outlet. Put your equipment far
away from monitors, TV sets and other devices with strong emission, otherwise
cables may pick up interference and you may experience data loss or
corruption. Never leave the parallel cable connected alone, only if the serial
cable is also connected, otherwise the lack of GND connection may severely
damage your equipment.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you have problems with your adaptor then you can test it
with <A HREF="scextprg.html#xctest">XCTest</A> and
<A HREF="scextprg.html#xcdetect">XCDetect</A>.</P>
