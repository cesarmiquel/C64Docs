<CENTER><H2>Star Tape</H2></CENTER>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This program was designed to create tape images by collecting PC64 file
images into them. It does not handle relative files since I have never seen
one. Star Tape is an external utility of The Star Commander but is also
distributed separately.</P>

<H3><A NAME="section1">1. Usage</A></H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">STARTAPE &lt;filename&gt;|@&lt;listname&gt; &lt;tapename&gt;</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&lt;filename&gt;:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Type the path and the mask of the source files here. You can use wildcards
to process multiple file images and you can use long filenames, too.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&lt;listname&gt;:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you have the list of the source files in a file, then type the path, the
name and the extension of the list file here. Note that you have to use a
short filename and prepend the "@" symbol to it.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&lt;tapename&gt;:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Type the path and the name of the tape image here (the extension of tape
images is always ".t64"). The directory of the tape image will have just
enough entries to hold all the converted files. You can use long filenames.</P>

<H3><A NAME="section2">2. Error messages</A></H3>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">FILENAME.EXT not found<BR>
The file does not exist.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cannot create FILENAME.EXT<BR>
The file could not be created for some reason.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Too many files<BR>
You may only convert a maximum of 499 files into a tape image.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">FILENAME.EXT has an invalid header<BR>
The usual header of file images was not found in the file.</P>
</UL>
