<H2>The Commodore parallel cable</H2>
for Commodore 1541, 1570 and 1571 drives
</CENTER>

<H3>Description</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The <B>Commodore parallel cable</B> is a companion cable
for the <A HREF="cbmser.html">Commodore serial cable</A> and gives you an
additional parallel connection between a Commodore 1541, 1570 or 1571 drive
and a Commodore machine.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To be precise, there are two quasi-standard parallel cables
for Commodore machines. The original <B>Speed DOS</B> parallel cable was
designed for Commodore 1541 drives only. It has become a standard since then
because this kind of parallel connection is supported by many other DOS
accelerators and stand alone copy software. A conceptionally similar parallel
cable is the one used by <B>Burst Nibbler</B> for 1570 and 1571 drives. To make
things simple, both will be called a Commodore parallel cable.</P>

<H3>Hardware requirements</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You need the following hardware to make use of this
cable:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Commodore 64, 128 or VIC20 machine</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Commodore 1541, 1570 or 1571 drive</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A <A HREF="cbmser.html">Commodore serial cable</A>
  between the drive and the machine</P>
</UL>

<H3>Software support</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The cable is supported by the following Commodore
software:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The DOS accelerators <B>Dolphin DOS</B> and <B>Speed
  DOS</B></P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The disk copiers <B>15 Second Copy</B>, <B>Burst
  Nibbler</B> and <B>Maverick</B></P>
</UL>

<H3>Important notes</H3>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This cable needs modifications in your Commodore drive.
  If you're not good at hardware hacking, please, don't try doing it yourself,
  ask for an expert's help.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This cable contains no GND connection because the
  serial cable already has one. Multiple GND connections may result in a
  "ground loop", when current is flowing between the two machines via the GND
  lines. This can cause not only unreliable behavior but also damage to your
  equipment. It may be possible to filter the GND lines so that they fulfill
  their primary purpose but not create a ground loop, however, such solutions
  may be relatively complicated and expensive.</P>
</UL>

<H3>Construction</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are several methods to build this cable.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Method 1.</B> You want to connect the cable directly
onto the periphery chip in the drive. You can find the details on how to build
this cable at the <A HREF="cbmpar41c.html">construction page for 1541
drives</A> and the <A HREF="cbmpar71c.html">construction page for 1570 and
1571 drives</A>.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you have successfully finished the parallel cable for
your drive then you can also build the adaptor version of the
<A HREF="xh1541.html">XH1541 hybrid cable</A>, the adaptor version of the
<A HREF="xp1541.html">XP1541 parallel cable</A> or the
<A HREF="xep1541a.html">XEP1541 adaptor</A>, to use the parallel capabilities
with a PC.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Method 2.</B> You want to create a parallel port on your
drive and then connect the cable to it. This is the more elegant method. You
can find the details on how to build this cable at the
<A HREF="cbmparc2.html">construction page</A>.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you have successfully finished the parallel port on your
drive then you can also build the <A HREF="xh1541.html">XH1541 hybrid
cable</A>, the <A HREF="xp1541.html">XP1541 parallel cable</A> or the
<A HREF="xep1541a.html">XEP1541 adaptor</A>, to use the parallel capabilities
with a PC.</P>

<H3>Pictures</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The assembled cable for Method 2 looks like this:
<A HREF="cbmpar.jpg">complete cable</A>, <A HREF="cbmparusr.jpg">user port
plug at machine end</A>, <A HREF="cbmpardrv.jpg">parallel plug at drive
end</A>, <A HREF="cbmpardrvprt.jpg">parallel port for drive</A>.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These pictures should give you an overall idea on how the
cable looks like and how it should be properly assembled. However, when
building a cable yourself, you should not rely on the pictures only; see the
construction guides instead.</P>

<H3>Usage</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you created a parallel port on your Commodore drive then
you can connect one end of the cable into it; otherwise the cable is,
probably, just hanging out of the drive. Switch your Commodore machine off.
Connect the user port plug onto the user port of your Commodore machine, being
very careful not to do it upside down. Switch your Commodore machine back
on.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Important!</B> Do not plug or unplug cables while your
equipment is switched on. Make sure that all components of your equipment are
connected to the same, properly grounded power outlet. Put your equipment far
away from monitors, TV sets and other devices with strong emission, otherwise
cables may pick up interference and you may experience data loss or
corruption. Never leave this cable connected alone, only if the serial cable
is also connected, otherwise the lack of GND connection may severely damage
your equipment.</P>
