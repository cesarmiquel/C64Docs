<H3>Usage</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Switch both Commodore machines off. Connect the user port
plugs onto the user ports of both Commodore machines, being very careful not
to do it upside down. Switch both Commodore machines back on.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Important!</B> Do not plug or unplug cables while your
equipment is switched on. Make sure that all components of your equipment are
connected to the same, properly grounded power outlet. Put your equipment far
away from monitors, TV sets and other devices with strong emission, otherwise
cables may pick up interference and you may experience data loss or
corruption.</P>
