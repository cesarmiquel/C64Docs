<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This program was designed to extract Commodore ARC archives into disk
images. It cannot create archives out of disk images and it cannot handle the
completely different PKARC format. Star ARC is an external utility of
The Star Commander but is also distributed separately.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CREDIT: Some algorithms and procedures of this program have been taken from
AX (&copy; by Chris Smeets, 1989).</P>

<H3><A NAME="section1">1. Usage</A></H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">STARARC [-]L &lt;arcname&gt;<BR>
   STARARC [-]X &lt;arcname&gt; [-|/4|7|8|C|D|X[D|P|S]|Y] [&lt;diskname&gt;] </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Commands:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">L: Lists the contents of archives. (List)</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">X: Extracts the contents of archives. (eXtract)</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&lt;diskname&gt;:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Type the path and the name of the disk images here (the extension is always
".d64" for 1541, ".d71" for 1571 and ".d81" for 1581 disk images). Leave this
parameter blank to extract the archives into disk images with the same name.
You can use long filenames.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&lt;arcname&gt;:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Type the path, the name and the extension of the archives here (the default
extension of ARC archives is ".arc"). You can use wildcards to list or extract
multiple archives and you can use long filenames, too.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Options:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4: Extracts data into 1541 disk images (default).</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">7: Extracts data into 1571 disk images.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">8: Extracts data into 1581 disk images.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">C: Asks for your confirmation about extracting each file.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">D: Deletes successfully processed source files.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">L: Displays Commodore filenames with the lowercase/uppercase character set
(default).</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">U: Displays Commodore filenames with the uppercase/graphics character set.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">X: Extracts data into 40-track 1541 disk images. You can choose the offset
of the additional BAM entries by adding "S" (Speed DOS, default), "D"
(Dolphin DOS) or "P" (Prologic DOS) to this option.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Y: Assumes "Yes" to all queries, good for running from batch files.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When decompressing an ARC archive, the program checks if the first file in
the archive has the name "title". If it does then this file contains a comment
which is displayed before decompression. However, the display routine can only
handle the control codes $0D (carriage return), $0E and $8E (changing to
lowercase/uppercase and uppercase/graphics character set). All other control
codes are omitted.</P>

<H3><A NAME="section2">2. Error messages</A></H3>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unknown command<BR>
The command is unknown.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Invalid option<BR>
The option is unknown or the syntax of its argument is wrong.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">FILENAME.EXT not found<BR>
The file does not exist.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cannot create FILENAME.EXT<BR>
The file could not be created for some reason.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"filename" exists...<BR>
It is not recommended to put two files with the same name into disk
images. You can skip, rename the file or extract it with its original
name.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cannot extract "filename" correctly<BR>
The file could not be fully extracted from the archive. It is possible
that the disk is full or the archive is corrupted, e.g. some bytes are
missing from its end or the checksum doesn't match.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">DISKNAME.D64 is not a valid disk image<BR>
The disk image is corrupted.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">DISKNAME.D64 has an invalid BAM<BR>
The BAM of the disk image is corrupted. Try validating the disk image.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Directory is full in DISKNAME.D64<BR>
The directory of the disk image is full. You can store a maximum of 144
files in a 1541 or 1571 disk image and 296 files in a 1581 disk image.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">DISKNAME.D64 is full<BR>
The disk image is full. You can store a maximum of 664 blocks in a 1541,
749 blocks in an extended 1541, 1328 blocks in a 1571 and 3160 blocks in a
1581 disk image.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ARCNAME.ARC is not a valid ARC archive<BR>
The ARC archive is corrupted.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ARCNAME.ARC has in invalid entry<BR>
The current entry of the ARC archive is corrupted.</P>
