<H2>Registering The Star Commander</H2>
last updated on 2004-04-16
</CENTER>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Star Commander is giftware. You may use the
unregistered version as long as you wish, it is in no way crippled, there are
no nag screens or delays in it and it won't refuse to run even years after the
installation. It is my personal will not to put any of these restrictions into
the Commander because I don't like such "features" in shareware software
either. However, if you appreciate the years of work it took to create the
Commander then you're encouraged to register it. My main reason for this is to
get some information about the people using the Commander all over the world
when they register but, of course, getting some money won't hurt either.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are only two things that may annoy you when using an
unregistered copy of the Commander: first, when you start it, you'll see three
extra lines below the title, asking you to register; second, there is a
similar sign in the uppermost lines of the "About the Commander" section of
the online help.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Please, fill in the registration form below. As a
registration text, you can type a maximum of 50 characters that will be
displayed in the Commander. Indicate if you want your name to be put to the
list of registered users (see REGISTER.TXT in the latest public release) and
whether you would like to see the amount of money you paid for the Commander
there or not.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When you're done, send the form to me in an E-mail by
pressing the "[Send registration form]" button. Soon you will receive a reply
containing a uuencoded keyfile that registers your copy. When registering, you
don't have to send any money, only if you want to: this is what "giftware" is
about. 10 USD, 10 EUR or the equivalent in your own currency (the proposed fee
for Hungarians is only 1000 HUF) would be quite satisfying but you can send me
more or less &ndash; it's up to you to decide how much the Commander is worth
for you.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You can send the money by cash in a snail-mail to me.
Please, don't send Eurocheques or coins, I can't change them to cash. Don't
send personal checks or money orders either because they involve high
conversion costs for me, if my bank accepts them at all. My home address is
the following:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Kov&aacute;cs Bal&aacute;zs<BR>
Orsolya u. 5. IV/12.<BR>
1204 Budapest<BR>
Hungary</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you register the Commander, the keyfile you get will
make those three annoying lines disappear forever. If you enter the "About the
Commander" section of the online help, you will see "This copy of The Star
Commander is registered to: &lt;registration text&gt;" in the uppermost lines.
If you have an E-mail address, you'll also be put onto the announcement list
so that you get a notification about new versions before the release day. You
will always remain a registered user, the keyfile will be valid with all
future releases. Your name is optionally going to be added to the list of
registered users at the end of REGISTER.TXT in the distribution package, so
that everyone sees you've already done the right thing.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a registered user, you won't get other extras because I
can't offer you more: the registered version doesn't have new features over
the unregistered version and if you have problems, I'll try to help you
independently of your being a registered user or not. However, by registering,
you can make sure you've made your moral (and, optionally, your monetary)
contribution to further development.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Please, don't distribute your personal keyfile when anyone
else can also register the Commander for free. Thank you.</P>

form and in the text displayed in the Commander.</P>
