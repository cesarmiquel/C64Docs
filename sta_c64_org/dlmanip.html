<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Drive Letter Manipulator</B> allows you to freely change
the letters of DOS drives from the command line. Its main purpose is restoring
the original drive letters after having installed another hard disk, which
process often results in the drive letters shifting around. It supports MS-DOS
versions 4.x and above and the DOS mode of Windows 95/98/ME, and Windows also
accepts the changes made by the software.</P>
