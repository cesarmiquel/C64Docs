<H2>Current beta release of The Star Commander</H2>
last updated on 2014-02-18
</CENTER>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On this page, you can find the current beta release of The
Star Commander and the Star Utilities.</P>

<H3>Important notes</H3>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Potentially unstable beta release.</B> This beta
  version may not be as stable as beta versions usually are, because of the
  code restructuring that was needed for the DOS 32-bit DPMI version. Please,
  be careful and make backups!</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Unregistered betas expire in one year.</B> As the
  author does not wish to get reports about old betas, they refuse to work one
  year after their release. If a valid personal keyfile is present, you "only"
  get an annoying message every time you launch the software. So, please,
  always download the latest beta. If you find a newer beta to be worse, in
  some respect, than an older beta or the previous public release,
  <A HREF="contact.html">contact</A> the author.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Read the documentation before complaining!</B>
  Before contacting the author about problems with accessing Commodore drives
  and/or transferring files, please, read the "Usage", "Troubleshooting" and
  "Known problems and limitations" sections in the documentation. If you still
  have problems then read the "Reporting problems" section in the
  documentation on how problems should be reported.<BR>
  Unfortunately, the author doesn't have much time for this project anymore,
  and especially few time to answer questions. Therefore, reports about any
  release other than the latest public or beta release, reports covered by the
  documentation and improper reports may be <U>rejected</U>.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>New name for personal keyfiles.</B> Since version
  0.81, the name of the personal keyfile has been changed from <B>sc.reg</B>
  to <B>sc.key</B> so that its extension doesn't conflict with that of Windows
  registry files. Please, rename your personal keyfile, to make it work
  again!</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Read docs for dosemu and Windows XP.</B> If you're
  running dosemu under GNU/Linux or using Windows XP then see the "Usage"
  section of the documentation for important information on how to make the
  Commander access Commodore drives in these environments. Windows XP users
  should also download the updated Windows NT/2000/XP tweak package and read
  the included documentation.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By downloading betas, you declare that you have read and
understood the important notes.</P>

<H3>Known major bugs</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Please, use the latest public release to overcome the
following problems until the next beta release, in which these will be fixed,
becomes available.</P>
