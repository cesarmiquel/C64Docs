<CENTER><H2>Star LFN</H2></CENTER>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">WARNING: This is far from being a complete program or documentation! This is
a test release, use it with great care! Keep visiting the Star LFN homepage at
<A HREF="http://sta.c64.org/starlfn.html">http://sta.c64.org/starlfn.html</A> for further releases.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Currently, the program has only experimental read-only support for VFAT, the
way file names are stored by Windows 95/98! This means that, if VFAT support
is enabled and you're writing files with long names onto the disk, the long
names will be destroyed because the program can't write VFAT yet!</P>

<H3><A NAME="section1">1. Introduction</A></H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This program is being designed to emulate the long file name functions that
are present in the DOS shells of Windows 95/98 but under plain DOS 4.0 or
above.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because of the intensive disk access, a disk cache in write-back mode is
highly recommended!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Programs similar to this one are the following:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">DOSLFN, by Henrik Haftmann and Jason Hood, is the best you can get
(download it from <A HREF="http://adoxa.altervista.org/doslfn/">http://adoxa.altervista.org/doslfn/</A>). If you want support for
VFAT, FAT32 and national code pages, this is the program you need!</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LFNDOS, by Chris Jones, was the one in the lead before (the old homepage
is not available anymore) but it is obsolete now because it has inferior
functionality and it contains some apparent bugs that may cause data loss
and which, as the program is abandoned, will, probably, be never fixed.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A proven bug is that, two directories with potentially the same short
alias &ndash; except for the numeric tail &ndash; will, eventually, get the same short
alias. E.g. if you create "LONGNAMEDIR1" and "LONGNAMEDIR2" in an empty
directory, both will get the short alias "LONGNA~1" which confuses DOS and
CHKDSK will destroy one of the directories!</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LONGNAME, in Caldera OpenDOS, refuses to run under original MS-DOS or DOS
clones other than OpenDOS &ndash; unless patched &ndash; and contains some annoying
bugs.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">DOSLFN, in Nuts &amp; Bolts 2.0, runs under DOS 7.x (the DOS of Windows 95/98)
only, has several bugs and locks up quite often.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a collection of such programs at <A HREF="http://sta.c64.org/lfnemu.html">http://sta.c64.org/lfnemu.html</A>.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This program has initially been tested in a less risky environment (see the
file access mode below), therefore its core is, probably, more robust and
stable than any of the programs mentioned above. In this program, you can
choose between two operational modes:</P>

<OL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">File access: Long file names are stored in a hidden system file called
"longname.dat" in each directory. This is the default mode, which is
compatible with any operating system that has an able DOS shell because
it involves significantly less hacking.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Disk access: Long file names are stored in the disk area allocated for
the directory. This is VFAT, the method Windows uses. In VFAT mode, this
program supports uncompressed FAT12 and FAT16 partitions only and has
been reported to fail on SCSI hard disks. WARNING: This mode is currently
experimental and read-only!</P>
</OL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Both modes work with ASSIGN'ed, JOIN'ed and SUBST'ed drives. Disk access
mode refuses to show long file names on CD drives and network drives because
these are stored with a completely different method, not VFAT.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The only way to exchange long file names between these two modes is putting
the files into an archive, with a LFN-aware archiver, in one operational mode
and extracting the files in the other mode.</P>

<H3><A NAME="section2">2. Usage</A></H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The parameter syntax is the following:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">STARLFN [-|/]&lt;options&gt;</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&lt;options&gt;:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I: Installs the program. As a secondary parameter, you can specify the
operational mode: D for disk access (VFAT), F for file access (hidden
system file, default).</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">U: Uninstalls the program.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Without any options specified, the program will show usage information.</P>

<H3><A NAME="section3">3. Technical background</A></H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The following INT 21h functions have already been implemented:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Flush buffers and cache (AX=710Dh and CX=0/1).</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Make directory (AX=7139h). Uses and updates data base.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Remove directory (AX=713Ah). Uses and updates data base.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Change directory (AX=713Bh). Uses data base.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Delete file (AX=7141h or AH=41h). Uses and updates data base.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Get/set file attributes (AX=7143h and BL=0/1). Uses data base.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Get current directory (AX=7147h). Uses data base.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Find first matching file (AX=714Eh). Uses data base.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Find next matching file (AX=714Fh). Uses data base.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rename file (AX=7156h or AH=56h). Uses and updates data base.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Get true name of file (AX=7160h and CL=0). Uses data base.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Get short name of file (AX=7160h and CL=1). Uses data base.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Get long name of file (AX=7160h and CL=2). Uses data base.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Create or open file (AX=716Ch). Uses and updates data base.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Get volume info (AX=71A0h).</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Close file search (AX=71A1h).</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Generate short alias (AX=71A8h).</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fake INT 21h functions:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Convert date stamps (AX=71A7h and BL=0/1). Does no conversion at all.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some nice features worth mentioning:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For certain programs, the emulators returns a false DOS version number of
7 and a false Windows version number of 4 because they refuse to use long
file names otherwise (currently, 4DOS and ARJ).</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The data base looks just like the DESCRIPT.ION files of 4DOS, the file
name was only changed to avoid confusion.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The data base is hidden from the directory list if the client program uses
long file name functions to read the directory.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The ordinary "remove directory", "delete file" and "rename file" functions
are redirected to their long file name counterparts so that no redundant
long file name entry remains when a LFN-unaware program deletes or renames
files or directories using their short file name.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several other DOS functions, such as "make directory", "change directory",
"create file", "open file", "get/set file attributes" and "extended open
file" are also redirected so that several LFN-unaware programs will be
able to use long file names without any modification.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The search handles used by a process are automatically closed when the
process exits.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The end-of-line mark in the data base can be any combination of carriage
returns and line feeds.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The following features still have to be implemented:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Support for 64-bit date stamps in "find first matching file" and "find
next matching file".</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A true "convert date stamps" function (AX=71A7h and BL=0/1). Until this is
finished, running the program under Windows 95/98 will mess up date stamps
in the directory list and also when files are touched.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some features that do not follow the behavior of Windows 95/98 exactly and
are unlikely to change (they would be either hard or useless to change):</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Flush buffers and cache" flushes buffers for all drives, can only flush
SmartDrive, Norton Cache or compatible cache programs and cannot remount
DriveSpace volumes (AX=710Dh and CX=2).</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Get/set file attributes" can't get compressed file size (AX=7143h and
BL=2).</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Get current directory" always returns a full long form path.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Get true file name" always returns a full long form absolute file name,
actually, it is done by the "get long file name" function.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">None of the file name conversion routines return any error code, even if
only a drive letter or a bad path is given or the drive letter is invalid.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The functions "get file info" (AX=71A6h), "server create or open file"
(AX=71A9h) and "create/terminate/query SUBST" (AX=71AAh and BH=0-2) are
not implemented at all.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some problems that are solved when VFAT support is enabled:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The data base is easy to tamper, there are no checksums in it, you can
even create multiple files with the same long file name.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Short file names may not contain spaces because the first space on a line
of the data base separates the short and long file names.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The line feed inserted into the data base is always CR/LF, independently
from the end-of-line mark actually used.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some problems that will be solved when VFAT support is finished:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Get/set file attributes" can't get or set Windows 95/98-specific file
date stamps (AX=7143h and BL=3-8).</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Find first matching file" and "find next matching file" can only return
DOS-style file date stamps and know nothing about Unicode either.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A problem which is probably impossible to overcome is that the original DOS
COMMAND.COM and external DOS commands cannot handle long file names so you
won't be able to pass long file names as parameters to them. By the way, this
is the reason why Caldera included a modified OpenDOS COMMAND.COM along with
their long file name support program: to smarten up, at least, the internal
DOS commands. A good solution is using 4DOS or booting DOS 7, which comes with
Windows 95/98, because their internal DOS commands are also capable of using
long file names, when available.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, with this program and a DOS-based LFN-aware file manager, you'll be
able to copy, rename, delete files and directories with long names under plain
DOS. You may even backup and restore your entire Windows 95/98 partition, file
by file, easily. Just, please, be patient until VFAT support is finished.</P>

<H3><A NAME="section4">4. Compatibility</A></H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The following programs have been tested and seem to work fine, without any
changes, in file access mode:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4DOS 7.01</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ARJ 2.71</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Info-ZIP 2.2 and 2.3, 32-bit DOS version</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">OpenDOS 7.01 COMMAND.COM</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PKUNZIP 2.04g</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Star Commander 0.82</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Volkov Commander 4.99 alphas</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The following programs have been tested but they have to be forced to use
Windows 95/98 long file name functions even under plain DOS:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4DOS 6.0x: Specifying "Win95LFN=Yes" in 4DOS.INI doesn't help because
"dir", which is correctly aliased to "dir *", only lists files without
extension, as if 4DOS were running under plain DOS! Note: This bug has
been fixed in 4DOS 7.0.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ARJ 2.60: It has to be fooled to be running under DOS 7.0 and Windows 4.0,
otherwise it won't use long file names at all. Note: This bug has been
fixed in ARJ 2.61.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The following programs have severe problems:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">HVSC_2 for Windows 95/98 (High Voltage SID Collection 1.6 &ndash;&gt; 2.0 update):
It keeps opening several hundred directory search records without closing
any of them. This is a bug in DJGPP: although opendir() and readdir() both
close the LFN search handle automatically when there are no more directory
entries to read, closedir() never does.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I haven't tested the programs above extensively, please, tell me if you find
some problems. Try this program with other LFN-aware programs, too, and tell
me about incompatibilities.</P>

<H3><A NAME="section5">5. History</A></H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">0.01 beta:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First release.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">0.02 beta:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Introducing the "rename" function, the ordinary DOS "rename" function is
redirected to this function.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Introducing the "volume info" function.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Short file names are recognized in a smart way and no long file name entry
is created for them.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No more strange effects when trying to read the root directory of a drive
under VC 4.99 alphas.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Improved compatibility with VC 4.99 alphas, 4DOS 6.01 and ARJ 2.60.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">0.03 beta:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Introducing the comparation of file names against the search file name
pattern in "find first matching file" and "find next matching file". Now
4DOS 6.01 does find external programs and ARJ 2.60 doesn't decompress all
files in the current directory upon startup.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4DOS is not fooled to be running under Windows 95/98 because it has an
option to force the usage of Windows 95/98 long file name functions
anyway.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">0.10 beta:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First public release.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4DOS is fooled again to be running under Windows 95/98, otherwise "dir",
that is, "dir *" will only list files without extension, as if 4DOS were
running under plain DOS.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now "delete file" accepts wildcards and search attributes.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The maximum number of search records available at a time has been raised
from 4 to 16.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several bugs, related to problems with the High Voltage SID Collection
1.6 &ndash;&gt; 2.0 update program, have been fixed.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the client program uses long file name functions to read the directory
then the entry of the data base (the short file name is "longname.dat")
will be hidden.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">0.11 beta:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Introducing the redirection of several other DOS functions, such as "make
directory", "change directory", "create file", "open file", "get/set file
attributes" and "extended open file".</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several small bugfixes.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">0.12 beta:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Introducing a standalone program, LFNDIR, that contains physical disk
access routines and can read Windows 95/98-style long file names off the
disk.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The tilde and number are now appended to short file names by default
because leaving them caused problems with the High Voltage SID Collection.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">0.20 beta:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The compatibility with the Windows 95/98 alias generation algorithm has
been improved: only those aliases get a tilde and a number, whose long
file name counterpart is too long and/or contains invalid characters. The
aliases of long file names conforming to the 8.3 format but containing
mixed case characters are simply the uppercase form of the long file name.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fully lowercase long file names can now be created.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now there are no problems if you only change the case of characters while
renaming a file.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You're not allowed to create two files whose names are basically the same
because only the case of some of the characters are different.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">File names that conform to the 8.3 format but whose name and extension
part is in different case are now recognized as long file names.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Only the first three characters of the extension is copied from the long
file name to its short equivalent.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The check for the validity of long file names is more thorough in LFNDIR.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LFNDIR displays long file names of a length of a multiple of 13 correctly.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">0.21 beta:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LFNDOS runs under Windows 95/98 and DOS 7.x, as well.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When browsing through the directory of Novell Netware drives, LFNDOS also
returns entries having the Shareable attribute set.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the LFNDOS source, you can also change the file attribute of
LONGNAME.DAT files created by the program. Switching the system and hidden
attributes off helps with getting rid of "unmovable files" in disk
defragmenter programs.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LFNDIR shows no volume labels and deleted files anymore, it displays the
short name of files in lowercase and that of directories in uppercase and
it displays file names starting with an E5h character correctly.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">0.22 beta:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Files with exactly nine characters in the name part of their file name are
now handled correctly.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When a client program reads through the directory using FindFirst and
FindNext, LFNDOS checks for the existence of LONGNAME.DAT only once and if
if not present, no checks are done during the remainder of the directory.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">0.23 beta:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Long file names starting with a space are now handled correctly.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Long file names that contain lowercase characters only and conform to the
DOS 8.3 file naming convention are not converted to full uppercase
anymore.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The "get true/short/long name of file" functions support the SUBST
expansion flag.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Introducing the "generate short alias" function.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Introducing support for the alias hint in the "create or open file"
function.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A problem with the "LONGNAME.DAT exists" flag, introduced in 0.22 beta,
that prevented Info-ZIP from archiving files with long names, has been
fixed.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LFNDIR prints out no startup message anymore, only the list of files.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A new compilation directive in LFNDIR allows you to make it list file
names in the format of LONGNAME.DAT files.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">0.24 beta:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">File accesses in the root directory of drives are now handled correctly.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ctrl-Break presses are not swallowed when the resident core is active, the
original interrupt handler is signalled upon exit from the core.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">0.25 beta:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Renamed the program to "Star LFN" so that its name doesn't conflict with
Chris Jones' LFNDOS anymore.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Uninstallation is now done by specifying the option '/U'.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No LFN entries are created anymore for file names that belong to a
standard device.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You get no more "File not found" error when opening standard devices
because they are assumed to "exist" in any directory, just like under
plain DOS.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">0.26 beta:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Instead of a fixed list of devices, the chain of actually installed
devices is walked through when checking file names. As a result, the last
two fixes of the previous release now apply to all actually installed
devices rather than standard devices only.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LFNDIR no more compares the first non-space character of the short and
long file names, that was an extra check to make sure the two file names
belong together.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">0.27 beta:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LFNDIR considers all LFN entries with their first byte having the 7th bit
set as deleted, rather than only entries with their first byte being E5h.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">0.30 beta (2002-03-10):</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Introducing experimental read-only VFAT support.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When started without any command line parameter, the program displays
usage information rather that installing itself at once.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Installation is now done by specifying the option '/I'.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Replaced a huge amount of magic numbers with named constants in the
source.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">0.31 beta (2002-09-08):</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moved the history into the main documentation.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fixed the lockup that occurred in VFAT mode when copying a directory
structure with long file names (the long file names are still not written
onto the disk though so you will get an error message anyway).</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">0.32 beta (2004-01-31):</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Updated the list about other similar programs in the documentation.</P>
