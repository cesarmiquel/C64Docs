<A HREF="cbmser.jpg">complete cable</A>, <A HREF="cbmgenserdin.jpg">DIN plug
at both ends</A>.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These pictures should give you an overall idea on how the
cable looks like and how it should be properly assembled. However, when
building a cable yourself, you should not rely on the pictures only; see the
construction guide instead.</P>

<H3>Usage</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Connect the two serial plugs into the serial ports on your
Commodore drive and your Commodore machine.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Important!</B> Do not plug or unplug cables while your
equipment is switched on. Make sure that all components of your equipment are
connected to the same, properly grounded power outlet. Put your equipment far
away from monitors, TV sets and other devices with strong emission, otherwise
cables may pick up interference and you may experience data loss or
corruption.</P>
