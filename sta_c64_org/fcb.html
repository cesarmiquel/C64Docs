<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>File Comparer &amp; Browser for DOS</B> allows you to
compare two binary files under real DOS and in the DOS shell of Windows. It
has an interactive interface that displays the files in two panels,
highlighting the differences. You can browse around both files, scrolling the
panels together (in sync) or separately. Long file names are supported, when
available.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>CREDIT:</B> The development of this software has been
taken over from <B>Vladimir Klebanov</B> who is developing the Linux version
(its homepage is down) but has abandoned the original DOS version.</P>
