<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For a complete list of cables and adaptors discussed on
these pages, see the <A HREF="cables.html">cables and adaptors page</A>. If
you're having problems with a cable then download
<A HREF="scextprg.html#xctest">XCTest</A> and test your cable with it.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The descriptions and construction guides on these pages are
for beginners. If you are a hardware expert then, please, bare with them.</P>

<H3>The interfaces</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are four serial cables and two additional parallel
cables. These all connect Commodore drives to the PC parallel port. Also,
using the serial cables, you can connect a Commodore machine to the PC, too.
Depending on what Commodore and PC hardware you have, what operating system
you are running on your PC and what transfer speed you want to achieve, you
may select among a number of cables and cable pairs. For a detailed guide on
selecting, see below.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The cables are the following. For more infos on each cable,
follow the link on the cable name.</P>

<H4><A NAME="serial">X1541-series serial cables</A></H4>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These are absolutely necessary, no data transfer will work
without them.</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The <A HREF="x1541.html">X1541 cable</A> is the
  original cable. It requires an <A HREF="parport.html">SPP</A> or
  <A HREF="parport.html">PS/2</A> parallel port and it's compatible with all
  Commodore machines and drives that have the usual serial bus port. However,
  it's not compatible with the parallel port integrated onto most Pentium and
  above motherboards.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The <A HREF="xe1541.html">XE1541 extended cable</A> is
  a substitute for the X1541 cable. It's also a serial cable and it's also
  compatible with all Commodore machines and drives that have the usual serial
  bus port but it works on all parallel ports, including the ones integrated
  onto most Pentium and above motherboards (see the info page for
  exceptions!).</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The <A HREF="xm1541.html">XM1541 multitask cable</A> is
  only a bit different from the XE1541 extended cable. It has two wires
  swapped at the Commodore end of the cable. This allows other transfer
  software to use interrupts rather than polling to do handshake with the
  Commodore drive under GNU/Linux. It's a serial cable, it's compatible with
  all Commodore machines and drives that have the usual serial bus port and it
  works on all parallel ports, including the ones integrated onto most Pentium
  and above motherboards (see the info page for exceptions!).</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The <A HREF="xa1541.html">XA1541 active cable</A> uses
  transistors and resistors rather than diodes. This makes it the ultimate
  transfer cable because it works even on those few motherboards that the
  XE1541 extended cable and the XM1541 multitask cable have problems with.
  This cable also works under GNU/Linux and is compatible with all Commodore
  machines and drives that have the usual serial bus port.</P>

cables then it is highly recommended that you read through this whole section.

you, you may jump to the <A HREF="#conclusion">conclusion</A> right away.</P>

<H4>Serial and parallel cables</H4>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To be able to transfer data between your Commodore drive
and your PC, first, you need a serial cable. Note that serial here means that
the cable is serial, even if you connect it to the parallel port of the PC.
You have four choices:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A HREF="x1541.html">X1541 cable</A> (recommended for
  old PC's only!),</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A HREF="xe1541.html">XE1541 extended cable</A>,</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A HREF="xm1541.html">XM1541 multitask cable</A>
  and</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A HREF="xa1541.html">XA1541 active cable</A>.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you have the serial cable finished and the transfer
software up and running with it and you have a Commodore 1541, 1570 or 1571
drive or compatible clone, you may think of speeding the transfer up with one
of the additional cables. Please, note that all these cables need
modifications in your Commodore drive. If you're not good at hardware hacking,
don't try doing it yourself but ask for an expert's help instead. Also, read
the transfer software's documentation on whether it supports these cables. You
have two choices:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A HREF="xh1541.html">XH1541/XH1571 hybrid cable</A>
  (recommended for old PC's only!) and</P>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A HREF="xp1541.html">XP1541/XP1571 parallel
  cable</A>.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The following charts describe the compatibility of the
cables with different parallel ports and software and how the cables can be
used together. This section should be considered as the central collection of
the information that you can find on the info pages of each cable.</P>

<H4>Compatibility with each other</H4>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The serial cables can be used alone. (That is, unless the
chosen software requires a parallel cable.) Parallel cables cannot be used
alone, they require the presence of a serial cable. However, not all pairs of
serial and parallel cables are possible. In general, you should not use the
<A HREF="xh1541.html">XH1541 hybrid cable</A> at all as it was designed to
bring the most out of old PC hardware only. It has been superseded years ago
by the <A HREF="xp1541.html">XP1541 parallel cable</A> that gives you higher
speed on a modern PC and can be used along with all serial cables.</P>

<H4>Compatibility with PC parallel port modes</H4>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For most integrated parallel ports on modern PC's, the mode
of your parallel port can be viewed and changed in the BIOS setup. For old
parallel port cards, you may have to use jumpers or its own software. It may
be possible that the BIOS setup or the parallel port software calls parallel
port modes differently: "Standard", "Compatible" or "Normal" usually stand for
SPP; "BPP" or "Extended" for PS/2. Some BIOS'es display the parallel port mode
incorrectly so, after having changed it, check the correct mode as reported by
<A HREF="dosprg.html#xctest">XCTest</A> or
<A HREF="sc.html">The Star Commander</A>.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The very old <A HREF="x1541.html">X1541 cable</A> does not
work with the integrated parallel ports of modern PC's, therefore, you should
choose it only if you want to use it with an old software and have an old PC
for this purpose. The <A HREF="xe1541.html">XE1541 extended cable</A> and the
<A HREF="xm1541.html">XM1541 multitask cable</A> have better compatibility
with modern PC's but they may have problems with laptops and a few desktop
motherboards (more details on the info pages).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The <A HREF="xa1541.html">XA1541 active cable</A> has the
best compatibility with parallel ports. Also, the integrated parallel port of
modern PC's are all compatible with the <A HREF="xp1541.html">XP1541 parallel
cable</A>. If you concentrate on hardware compatibility, these two cables are
the best choices.</P>

<H4>Compatibility with PC software</H4>

the main functionality. A transfer software makes the PC act as a Commodore
machine &ndash; the master of the serial bus &ndash;, letting you access the
contents of disks in attached Commodore drives from the PC. A file server or
emulator makes the PC act as a Commodore drive &ndash; a slave on the serial
bus &ndash;, letting you access the contents of emulated disk drives from the
Commodore machine.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the past, the <A HREF="xe1541.html">XE1541 extended

<H4>Compatibility with Commodore drives and machines</H4>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Don't let the "1541" in the names of the cables fool you:
all the serial cables &ndash; <A HREF="x1541.html">X1541</A>,
<A HREF="xe1541.html">XE1541</A>, <A HREF="xm1541.html">XM1541</A> and
<A HREF="xa1541.html">XA1541</A> &ndash; are compatible with all Commodore
drives that have the usual serial port; this includes 1541, 1570, 1571 and
1581 drives and compatible clones and other Commodore drives, too. Also, the
serial cable can be plugged into the serial port of a Commodore machine, as
well, making the PC emulate Commodore drives; this includes all C64 and C128
flavors. However, it is up to the software whether it can transfer from/to a
particular drive or whether it can emulate it. As the 1541 drive is the most
popular of all, you can expect all transfer and emulator software to support
or emulate it; see the software documentation about support of other
drives.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As for hardware compatibility, the XA1541 cable simulates
the circuitry found in the serial bus ports of Commodore machines and drives.
For this reason, it can cope with multiple devices on the same serial bus,
daisy chained with plain Commodore serial cables from the first one that the
X1541-series cable is connected to. On the other hand, the XE1541 and XM1541
cables cannot drive the serial bus strong enough in such cases: the result is
unreliable data transfer, damaged or lost data. But, for a single Commodore
machine or drive connected to the PC, any of the serial cables will do.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The parallel cables are available in two flavors each: the
<A HREF="xh1541.html">XH1541</A> and <A HREF="xp1541.html">XP1541</A> cables
are for 1541 drives, the <A HREF="xh1541.html">XH1571</A> and
<A HREF="xp1541.html">XP1571</A> cables are for 1570 and 1571 drives. The
1541 and 1570/1571 flavors are identical in concept and usage, only their
implementation differs, because of the hardware differences between 1541 and
1570/1571 drives. There are no known similar implementations of parallel
cables for 1581 drives or other Commodore drives. If you need an additional
parallel cable between the PC and a Commodore machine, use the
<A HREF="pwrload.html">Power-Loader cable</A> instead.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The following cable shows the compatibility between
the transfer software and different Commodore drives; "+P" means that an
additional parallel connection, via an <A HREF="xp1541.html">XP1541/XP1571
parallel cable</A> is also supported. The Commodore drives are supposed to be
running in their native mode; the 1541 emulation mode of 1570 and 1571 drives
is considered to be identical to genuine 1541 drives.</P>

<H4>Compatibility with Commodore software and disks</H4>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The serial cables are intentionally of simple design and do
not aim at achieving the highest transfer speeds possible.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Transfer programs, that use the serial cables, should be
able to transfer a single side of a 1541 disk in a few minutes, depending on
the transfer mode (the disk turbo and the data transfer protocol) used.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Emulator and file server programs, that use the serial
cables, cannot and, therefore, do not support disk turbos, only the standard
Commodore IEC transfer speed. It may be possible, though, that the emulator
software itself contains its own disk turbo (in a routine that invisibly
autoloads and autostarts before the actual program being loaded) or it can
detect GEOS running in the Commodore machine and can tell GEOS how to use the
emulated drive at a higher speed. See the software documentation for such
information. If you need a cable that lets software emulate Commodore drives
at a very low level and support (some!) disk turbos, use the (more
complicated) <A HREF="1541emu.html">1541EMU cable</A> instead.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With an <A HREF="xp1541.html">XP1541/XP1571 parallel

<H4>Compatibility with Commodore disk-based copy protections</H4>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With a transfer software and a serial cable only, you may

<H4><A NAME="conclusion">Conclusion</A></H4>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Not all software may support the cable of your
choice.</B> As you can see above, not all software support all cables (or
cable combos). If you make your choice according to hardware compatibility but
your favorite software does not support the chosen cable (or cable combo) then
you may want to ask the author to incorporate support. However, if the
software is not developed anymore or your request for support is rejected or
ignored then you have to make a compromise between hardware and software
compatibility. Also, your cable choice may be based on the fact that your goal
can be achieved with a single software only.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>The XM1541 multitask cable is the best compromise.</B>
On a modern PC, the best compromise for software and hardware compatibility is
the <A HREF="xm1541.html">XM1541 multitask cable</A> because:</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">it is supported by most software currently being

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">the software, that support it, run on a wide range of

</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>You can convert an XE1541 extended cable into an XM1541

into an XM1541 multitask cable, by <A HREF="xm1541c3.html">rewiring it</A> or
with the compact <A HREF="xem1541a.html">XE/M1541 adaptor</A>.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>The XA1541 active cable has the best hardware
compatibility.</B> If hardware compatibility (including possible compatibility
with future PC's) is your absolute priority, the <A HREF="xa1541.html">XA1541
active cable</A> is for you. Its advantage over the XM1541 multitask cable is
that:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">it works with all parallel ports (until now, only one
  &ndash; probably, misdesigned or buggy &ndash; motherboard is known to not
  support it);</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">it works with multiple Commodore devices attached to
  the same serial bus (while the XM1541 cable can't drive the serial bus
  strong enough in such cases).</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Its disadvantage is that:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">it is difficult to build (and expensive to buy).</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is similar to the XM1541 multitask cable in that:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Add the XP1541/XP1571 parallel cable for higher transfer

thus establishing an additional parallel connection between the Commodore
drive and the Commodore machine &ndash; or into an
<A HREF="xep1541a.html">XEP1541 adaptor</A> or an
<A HREF="xap1541a.html">XAP1541 adaptor</A> &#150 for a parallel connection
between the Commodore drive and a PC.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The XEP1541 adaptor is a small circuit board that has a
port for the usual <A HREF="cbmser.html">Commodore serial cable</A> and a card
edge for the Commodore parallel cable. Plug the Commodore serial cable onto
the adaptor, plug the adaptor itself into the PC parallel port and you get an
XE1541 cable; if you need an XM1541 cable, use a
<A HREF="cbmsertc.html">twisted Commodore serial cable</A> instead of the
normal Commodore serial cable (the XMP1541 adaptor has not been implemented);
when an XA1541 cable is needed, use the XAP1541 adaptor instead. If you also
plug the Commodore parallel cable onto the adaptor, you get an additional
XP1541/XP1571 parallel cable.</P>
