<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is still not the final release of The Star Commander. Look out for
further releases. Please, report bugs and ideas to the author because Version
1.0 is supposed be the final release.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because it took a significant amount of time to create this documentation,
you are also expected to take the time to read it thoroughly. For a list of
important URL's, where you can find more information about the Commander and
the cables it uses, see the "Related Net resources" section.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you're using the Commander for the first time then read the "Usage"
section. When having problems, read the "Troubleshooting" and "Known problems
and limitations" sections, as well. If your problem is not covered there then
read the "Reporting problems" section on how a proper report should look like.
Unfortunately, the author doesn't have much time for this project anymore, and
especially few time to answer questions. Therefore, reports about any release
other than the latest public or beta release, reports covered by the
documentation and improper reports may be deleted without any reply! YOU HAVE
BEEN WARNED!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Note: This documentation is meant to be viewed with a monospace font, in IBM
code page 437 (US default for DOS). With a proportional font, tables and
ASCII art drawings will fall apart; with other code pages, including but not
limited to DOS 85x, Windows 125x and ISO 8859-x, national characters will look
strange. You may want to view this file from the Commander itself. Obviously,
this paragraph does not apply to the HTML version of this document.</P>

<H3><A NAME="section1">1. Introduction</A></H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This software handles the image files of the C64 Software Emulator (C64S,
&copy; by Miha Peternel and Seattle Lab, 1994-1997), the CCS64 emulator (&copy; by
Per H&aring;kan Sundell, 1996-2009), Personal C64 (PC64, &copy; by Wolfgang Lorenz,
1994-1997) and VICE (&copy; by the VICE Team, 1993-2009). It copies files and
disks between the PC and external Commodore 1541, 1570, 1571 and 1581 drives
and converts several Commodore archive formats.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is similar to The Norton Commander (NC, &copy; by Symantec Inc., 1986-1995)
and The Volkov Commander (VC, &copy; by Vsevolod V. Volkov, 1991-2000) so it will
surely be easy to use. However, before you start using it, please, read this
documentation and the online help carefully, for the differences from the
other Commanders, the description of the X1541-series interfaces and other
details.</P>

<H3><A NAME="section2">2. Copyright and license</A></H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Star Commander is copyright &copy; by Joe Forster/STA, 1994-2010.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Commander is giftware. You may use the unregistered version as long as
you wish and you may give it to any individual, provided that it's in the
original, unmodified archive. It is highly recommended that you download
distribution packages from the homepage or other distribution sites listed
later in this documentation. If you get a package from somewhere else then
make sure that the package has the author's authentic verification stamped on
it.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The unregistered version is in no way crippled, there are no nag screens or
delays in it and &#150; except for alpha and beta releases &#150; it never expires.
However, if you are frequently using the Commander and you are satisfied with
it then you are encouraged to register it. Please, read the file REGISTER.TXT
for more details. You must not distribute the personal keyfile you receive
when you register.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The source of the Commander is distributed under a license that is similar
to the GNU Public License but is more restrictive, for the protection of
Commander users and the author. You may distribute only those modified
versions or derived softwares that satisfy all restrictions in the license.
When you distribute the Commander, modified versions of it or softwares
derived from it, you may not ask for money above the normal fee of the
distribution media itself. Furthermore, you may not publish the Commander or
its source on floppy disks, CD/DVD-ROM's, FTP sites, WWW pages or any other
distribution media, include it in a software compilation or bundle it with
other software or hardware without prior permission of the author.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Note that public distribution of the beta releases of the Commander is
prohibited. The only place where you can and should be able to find them is
the homepage.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Commander is provided "as is", without a warranty of any kind. You are
using it at your own risk. The author is not liable for any damage or data
loss caused by the software.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Commander supports the following X1541-series cables:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">X1541 cable (&copy; by Leopoldo Ghielmetti, 1992)</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">XE1541 extended cable (&copy; by Nicolas Welte and Wolfgang Moser, 1997)</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">XM1541 multitask cable (&copy; by Michael Klein and Nicolas Welte, 2000)</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">XH1541/XH1571 hybrid cables (&copy; by Bigfoot, 1997)</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">XP1541/XP1571 parallel cables (&copy; by Joe Forster/STA, 1997)</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you produce and sell cables or adaptors that are compatible with these
cables &#150; except for the original X1541 cable &#150;, you must give credits to the
respective copyright owner or copyright owners. If your adaptors are built
onto printed circuit boards then you must also make the complete layout
available in a format and resolution that is suitable for high quality
reproduction so that people may build the adaptors themselves, if they want.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This common license for the cables is an agreement among the cable authors.
However, because the author of the original X1541 cable couldn't be contacted
for an inquiry, this license does not apply to the original X1541 cable.</P>

<H3><A NAME="section3">3. System requirements</A></H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You must have an IBM-compatible PC with the following hardware and software
to run the Commander:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">an 80286 processor or higher,</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">an MDA/Hercules/CGA/EGA/VGA/SVGA video card and monitor,</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">about 500 kilobytes of free conventional memory or more,</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">MS-DOS 3.20 or higher installed.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Instead of MS-DOS, DOS clones such as DR-DOS, FreeDOS or Caldera OpenDOS
should also work fine, although compatibility with these operating systems
hasn't been thoroughly tested. If you have access to any of these, information
would be welcome!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You may try using the Commander under GNU/Linux dosemu or in the DOS shell
of OS/2 or Windows 3.x/95/98/ME/NT4/2000/XP/2003. It has also been reported
that the Commander runs, under VirtualPC, on a Macintosh, as well. For more
information on using the Commander under an operating system other than DOS,
see the "Usage" section. However, remember that, even if some extra
functionality was implemented to make the Commander run better under
multi-tasking systems, you are expected to run it under real DOS, to get the
best results.</P>

<H3><A NAME="section4">4. Installation</A></H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You can install the Commander by simply decompressing the distribution
package using PKZIP 2.xx, Info-ZIP's unzip 5.xx or any other ZIP-compatible
software. You don't need all the files to run the Commander, most of them are
only for your comfort.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Required:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SCMAIN.EXE: For a minimum installation, you need the main executable.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recommended:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SC.EXE: If you want to have much more memory in the DOS shell, keep this
loader and launch it instead of the main executable.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SC.HLP: Keep this to enable the online help.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SCVIEW.EXE, SCEDIT.EXE: With their help, you can view and edit DOS files
and Commodore files inside image files and uncompressed archive files.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Optional:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SCSETUP.EXE: Allows you to change the settings of the Commander outside
the software.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*.MNU, *.EXT: Some sample menu and extension files to help you with
handling PC and Commodore archives and formatting PC disks.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PALETTES.ZIP: Some predefined color palettes that resemble those of other
Commanders and Commander clones.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PRINTHLP.EXE: Run this to extract the online help into a text file or to
send it to a printer.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SC.ICO, SC.PIF, ICONS.ZIP: If you want to use the Commander under OS/2 or
Windows 3.x/95/98/ME/NT4/2000/XP then these are just for you.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SC_WINNT.ZIP: Tweak package that allows the Commander to access Commodore
drives under Windows NT4/2000/XP/2003. For more details, see the
documentation inside the package.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SUxyy.ZIP: Contains the Star Utilities (version x.yy), the external
utilities that help you with mass-converting Commodore archive formats.
For more details, see the documentation inside the package. This package
is also available separately, on its own homepage.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the distribution package of a beta release of the Commander, some files
may be missing. Get those files from the distribution package of the previous
public release, which is available at the homepage.</P>

<H3><A NAME="section5">5. Usage</A></H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you already registered the Commander and your personal keyfile is called
"sc.reg" then, please, rename it to "sc.key" so that it is again recognized!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Please, note that there's no documentation on how to use the Commander.
However, the context-sensitive online help contains the information on how to
use each function; press F1 to pop it up. If you're using the Commander for
the first time then read the online help carefully, to find out what the
Commander is capable of. You may want to use the included help printer
software to save the online help into a plain text file or send to your
printer, to read it later. Run the help printer software without parameters to
see its command line syntax.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you would like to access Commodore drives then always switch off your
Commodore drive and your PC before plugging or unplugging the cables that
connect them. When using an optional parallel cable, make sure that the
parallel cable is never connected to both machines alone, only along with the
serial cable. If you don't follow these guidelines, you may severely damage
your equipment!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you did a minimum installation then start the software with SCMAIN.EXE.
If you also have the loader then start the software with SC.EXE. They accept
the following optional command line parameters:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SC [-|/&lt;options...&gt;] [&lt;startup command&gt;]</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">or</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SCMAIN [-|/&lt;options...&gt;]</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Options are case-insensitive and have to start with either a hyphen or a
slash; in the list below, slashes are used. Valid options are the following:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">/?: Displays the help screen of command line parameters.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">/nolpt: Disables access of parallel ports completely. You will not be able
to use Commodore drives from your PC but, in change, no strange behavior
will occur either because the Commander will not touch the parallel ports
at all. See below for a list of such strange behaviors.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">/novesa: Disables support for VESA BIOS extensions, in case it causes
strange behavior on incompatible hardware. Note that this command line
option overrides the "VESA support" option in the configuration menus but
also affects startup. Therefore, you should use it if the Commander can't
even start up properly.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">/noxms: Disables XMS usage. Currently, XMS is used for swapping overlay
data only. Use this option if you're experiencing lockups or crashes
already when the Commander starts up.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">/noems: Disables EMS usage. Currently, EMS is used for swapping overlay
data only. Use this option if you're experiencing lockups or crashes
already when the Commander starts up.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">/color, /bw and /laptop: Forces the color, black &amp; white and laptop
palette. Note that this command line option overrides the "Screen color"
option in the configuration menus. Also, it has no effect on monochrome
displays.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">/cmd: Executes a single batch command or a script consisting of several
batch commands. See the next section on batch processing. The complete
command line after this option is considered to be a batch command.
Therefore, if you want to specify other options, as well, put them before
this one.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With the exception of "/cmd", these options are available for the external
setup program, SCSETUP.EXE, as well.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The startup command is a DOS command that is executed before the Commander
starts up. Note that the main executable, SCMAIN.EXE, itself is unable to
execute startup commands; only the loader, SC.EXE, is.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Operating system-specific extra requirements for running the Commander and
accessing Commodore drives are the following:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">GNU/Linux dosemu: If the Commander crashes dosemu, specify the "/noxms"
option for the Commander or disable the XMS support of dosemu, by setting
"$_xms" to "(0)" in dosemu.conf. Even if there are no crashes, XMS may not
be used. This is the consequence of an implementation problem in the XMS
support of dosemu.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To be able to access Commodore drives, enable access to the necessary
hardware ports, by adding them to "$_ports" in dosemu.conf. These ports
are "range 0x40,0x43", "0x61" and one or more of the parallel ports. The
standard parallel ports are "range 0x0278,0x027B range 0x0678,0x067B" (the
second range is necessary for ECP ports only), "range 0x0378,0x037B range
0x0778,0x077B" and "range 0x03BC,0x03BF range 0x07BC,0x07BF". If you have
a custom parallel port then add an address range of between (base address)
and (base address + 3) and, for ECP ports, another range of between (base
address + 0x0400) and (base address + 0x0403).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This has been successfully tested with FreeDOS Beta 8 (2002-12-20) and
MS-DOS 5.00, running in dosemu 1.0.2.1 (2001-10-13) and Red Hat Linux 8.0.
See <A HREF="http://www.dosemu.org">http://www.dosemu.org</A> for the latest version of dosemu and a copy of
FreeDOS, configured to be run under dosemu.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Beware, the Commander uses a great percentage of CPU time during access
to Commodore drives, thus degrading system performance significantly!</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Macintosh VirtualPC: Visit <A HREF="http://www.welovemacs.com/idock.html">http://www.welovemacs.com/idock.html</A> for the
iDock. After having installed the hardware and the software bundled with
it, VirtualPC will recognize the parallel port built into the iDock and
allow the Commander to use the port for communication with the Commodore
drive.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you have successfully done this, a detailed step-by-step guide would be
welcome!</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">OS/2: To be able to access Commodore drives, enable the HW_TIMER option in
the DOS settings.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you have successfully done this, more information would be welcome!</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Windows 3.x: No extra requirements.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Windows 95/98/ME: No extra requirements.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Windows NT4/2000/XP/2003: Try accessing the Commodore drive via the
OpenCBM driver or see the separate tweak package for more information.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">General guidelines on accessing Commodore drives under a multi-tasking
operating system with the Commander are the following:</P>

<OL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, make sure that the same setup works properly under real DOS. If
you don't have DOS, get a copy of FreeDOS from <A HREF="http://www.freedos.org">http://www.freedos.org</A>. If
you have no FAT partition, to install DOS onto, on your hard disk, use a
boot floppy disk instead.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the "Transfer options" menu, set "Transfer mode" to "Warp".</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Disable "Manual timeouts".</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Set "Async transfer" to "Auto" or "Always", otherwise you will get
nothing else than timeouts or lockups.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Check if "Serial interface" and &#150; if using a parallel cable, as well &#150;
"Parallel interface" show the correct parallel port.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under GNU/Linux dosemu, the standard "LPTx" ports are not available.
Enter the address(es) of your parallel port(s) into the custom parallel
port slot(s).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under Windows NT4/2000/XP/2003, even if you have only one parallel port,
it is not necessarily called "LPT1" in the DOS shell. To make sure that
the Commander tries to access the appropriate parallel port(s), you might
be better off with throwing away the three standard parallel port slots
and entering the address(es) of your parallel port(s) into the custom
parallel port slot(s).</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Press the "Recalibrate" button, to have the "Delay value" recalculated
for operation under the new environment. Or, even better, set "Delay
value" to 0, to always use an autodetected delay value.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under Windows NT4/2000/XP/2003, your best choice is using the OpenCBM
driver. First, make sure that cbm4win 0.4.0 or above is installed and is
working properly. Then set "Serial cable" to "OpenCBM".</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Don't expect miracles! Some of the communication between the PC and the
Commodore drive is done with the standard IEC protocol which is not
designed for multi-tasking systems. You shouldn't be surprised at
occasional timeouts or lockups at the beginning or the end of disk
operations, especially if your system is heavily loaded.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For this reason, it is recommended that you copy disks only and avoid
copying files.</P>
</OL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To configure the Commander for your needs, enter the "Configuration..." item
of the "Options" menu and go through all options in all configuration screens,
reading the corresponding paragraph of the online help on your way. Proper
configuration is especially important if you want to access a Commodore drive.
Go to the main configuration screen, enter the "Transfer options" menu and
set, at least, the following options:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Transfer mode": For 1541, 1570 and 1571 drives, you should set it to
"Warp" because this is not only the fastest but also the most reliable of
all.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For 1581 drives, you may set it to "Turbo". Note that, at this moment, not
all disk turbos are finished for 1581 drives so, if experiencing lockups,
you will have to temporarily switch back to "Normal" transfer mode.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Serial cable": Set the type of your serial cable (X1541, XE1541, XM1541
or XA1541) here. Note that these cables are serial, even if you connect
them to the parallel port of the PC. Under Windows NT4/2000/XP/2003, set
"OpenCBM" to make the Commander access the Commodore drive via the OpenCBM
driver. Use "None" if you connected a real PC printer that would get
confused when the Commander initializes the parallel port.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Parallel cable": Set the type of your parallel cable (XH1541/XH1571 or
XP1541/XP1571) here. Use "None" if you have no parallel cable or you don't
want the Commander to touch the corresponding parallel port.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Async transfer": You should set it to "Auto".</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Manual timeouts": You should have it disabled all the time.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Delay value": Press the "Recalibrate" button, to have a (nearly) optimal
value computed for your machine. Or, even better, set to 0, to always use
an automatically calibrated value. Note that this value depends on the
effective CPU speed which is affected by the raw CPU speed, the operating
system and the CPU load.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Make sure to either always use a value of 0 or recalibrate whenever using
a preconfigured copy of the Commander in a different environment: on
another PC and/or under another operating system.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Serial interface": Set the parallel port that your X1541-series serial
cable is connected to. If your parallel port has a non-standard address,
select one of the custom slots and enter the port address in hexadecimal
notation.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Parallel interface": Set the parallel port your X1541-series parallel
cable is connected to. If your parallel port has a non-standard address,
select one of the custom slots and enter the port address in hexadecimal
notation.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Detect port modes": Set it to "All" to have warnings displayed about
possible transfer problems. However, this may cause strange behavior on
certain hardware, including lockups. In such cases, set this option to
"None" and hard reboot your PC or restart the DOS shell. For debug
purposes, you may set it to "Used" so that the mode of only those parallel
ports is detected that are configured in the "Serial interface" and/or
"Parallel interface" options. If you experience long delays or crashes
under Windows NT4/2000/XP/2003, use "SafeAll" or "SafeUsed" to skip port
mode detection under these operating systems but behave similarly to "All"
and "Used" under others.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Drive type": Set the type of your Commodore drive here. For more details,
see the "Commodore drives" section in the online help.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under certain circumstances, the usage of the parallel ports may cause
strange behavior:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Symptom: After having started the Commander, not even a printer can be
accessed anymore, until the PC is rebooted.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reason: Possibly, your parallel port falls into an unusable state when the
Commander tries to detect its mode.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Solution: Set "Detect port modes" to "None" and hard reboot your machine.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Symptom: There is a complete system lockup whenever the Commander is
started.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reason: Certain integrated parallel ports lock up the chipset when their
mode is probed. Note that this is definitely a hardware bug as the same
occurs when GNU/Linux checks the parallel ports while booting up.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Solution: Set your parallel port to another mode in the BIOS setup and try
again. If none of the modes work without a lockup, set "Detect port modes"
to "None".</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Symptom: Under Windows NT4/2000/XP/2003, there are long delays upon
startup or a few seconds/minutes after the Commander has started.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reason: When the Commander tries to detect the mode of the parallel port,
Windows gets confused.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Solution: Set "Detect port modes" to "None", "SafeAll" or "SafeUsed" and
restart the DOS shell.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Symptom: Under Windows NT4/2000/XP/2003, when a real PC printer is
attached, a page with garbage characters is printed upon every startup of
the Commander.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reason: When the Commander initializes the parallel ports, Windows may
think it wants to print something and forwards weird data to the printer.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Solution: Set "Serial cable" to "None" to have the parallel port
initialization skipped.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Symptom: Under Windows NT4/2000/XP/2003, with cbm4win/OpenCBM installed,
the drive keeps resetting itself indefinitely.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reason: The drive has been connected (or switched on) when Windows already
booted up and the OpenCBM driver couldn't find out the type of the cable
correctly.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Solution: Stop and restart the OpenCBM driver, with the "net stop opencbm"
and "net start opencbm" commands or other methods.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you specify the "/nolpt" option upon startup, all these problems should
be gone (although you won't be able to use Commodore drives either). Then you
can enter the configuration menus and change the settings as recommended
above. If the "/nolpt" option doesn't solve your problems then their reason is
obviously not the way the Commander accesses the parallel ports.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To use the built-in drive of a C128D or an SX64 or to use the same Commodore
drive from a Commodore machine and a PC, you must execute a POKE command on
the Commodore machine:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Commodore 64/128: "POKE 56576, PEEK(56576) AND 239" or simply "POKE 56576,
199".</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Commodore Plus4: "POKE 1, PEEK(1) OR 1".</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Commodore VIC20: "POKE 37137, PEEK(37137) OR 3".</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This decouples the Commodore machine from the common serial bus, by
switching the CLK line to high. Every time you access the drive from the
Commodore machine, you'll have to issue this command again afterwards. Note
that the Commander decouples the PC automatically from the serial bus one
second after having completed a disk operation.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you have problems with accessing Commodore drives from your PC, you can
find more solutions in the "Troubleshooting" section of this documentation.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you are experiencing screen-related problems or lockups upon startup,
even under real DOS with the "/nolpt" option specified, try one or more of the
following:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Specify the "/novesa" option so that no VESA functions are used. This
should solve problems with video cards that either have no VESA-compatible
BIOS or the VESA support in their BIOS is buggy.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Install ANSI.SYS from CONFIG.SYS. If you're using Windows
NT4/2000/XP/2003, use CONFIG.NT in the SYSTEM32 directory instead of
CONFIG.SYS.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Install a VESA BIOS extension driver for your video card. If there is no

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you would like to use long file names with the Commander then be advised
that they are not available under all operating systems:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">DOS: Long file names are not available. Install a LFN emulator for DOS.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">GNU/Linux dosemu: Long file names are not available.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you know a solution for this, information would be welcome!</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Macintosh VirtualPC: Unknown.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you have access to this, information would be welcome!</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">OS/2: Unknown.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you have access to this, information would be welcome!</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Windows 3.x: Long file names are not available. Install a LFN emulator for
DOS before launching Windows.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Windows 95/98/ME: The operating system supports long file names in its DOS
shells.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Windows NT4: Long file names are not available. Install a LFN emulator for
Windows NT.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Windows 2000/XP/2003: The operating system supports long file names in its
DOS shells.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You can download such softwares from the LFN emulators page. If you can't
make the Commander access real long file names under your operating system
then store your files in containers that do support long file names: TAR and
ZIP archives are widely used, their archiver softwares are available for many
platforms and the Commander supports them, too. Thus, you can exchange long
file names between the Commander and other platforms and/or applications.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To be able to handle LHA and ZIP archives, the Commander needs the following
external archiver softwares that are available free of charge:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LHA for DOS; version 2.14 or above (lha.exe).</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Info-ZIP for DOS, 16-bit version; zip 2.20 or above (zip16.exe, renamed to
zip.exe) and unzip 5.40 or above (unzip.exe).</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You can download these from the useful external softwares page. Do not use:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LHA for DOS, older versions (below 2.14). These corrupt data when
extracting it from archives the way preferred by the Commander.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LHA for Windows. Obviously, it doesn't work under DOS.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Info-ZIP for DOS, older versions (zip below 2.20 or unzip below 5.40). The
Commander hasn't been tested with those.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Info-ZIP for DOS, 32-bit version. It has severe problems with certain
memory managers and DPMI servers.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Info-ZIP for Windows. Obviously, it doesn't work under DOS.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PKZIP. It is not available free of charge and it doesn't support the
extraction method used by the Commander anyway.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Apart from these, the Commander relies on no external software: all other
file formats and conversions are handled internally. Also, you shouldn't worry
about long file names copied into or extracted from archives: the Commander
will take care of them, even if the external archiver software doesn't.</P>

<H3><A NAME="section6">6. Batch processing</A></H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Normally, the Commander is used in interactive mode. However, if you'd like
to automatically copy, convert or archive files or disks, you can build
scripts that the Commander executes with as few user interaction as possible.
Please, note that the concept of the Commander has not been designed for
non-interactive use, therefore, in many cases, user input will be necessary to
continue the current operation. If you are annoyed about certain error
messages, confirmation prompts or input dialogs, contact the author with your
suggestions on how to get rid of them.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This section assumes that you already know how the Commander works. If you
don't, spend more time in the interactive environment and read the online
help, to get familiar with the Commander's features.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Important notes about the current status of the batch processing capability:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you leave the default "Ask" value for automatic replies (see below),
some confirmation messages may be displayed. Also, there are confirmation
and error messages as well as dialog boxes, waiting for the user to input
some necessary data, that cannot be suppressed. These are displayed in the
same manner as in the interactive environment but on top of the underlying
DOS screen.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Currently, there are no plans to change this because converting these
dialog boxes into a few lines of text, printed onto the DOS screen, would
be too much work. And it wouldn't be of much use either because the
standard input and output cannot be easily redirected from/to a file
anyway. If you have suggestions, contact the author.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are batch variables that are related to the interactive environment
only, therefore, there's no sense using them in scripts: e.g. displaying
the sizes of DOS files in blocks rather than bytes; whether files, already
processed during a file operation, should be unselected at once or only
after having processed all the files etc.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a later release, it will be possible to save the complete setup into
and load it from a script file as well, not only the binary setup file
like now. This helps with importing the settings of older releases into
newer ones.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Below, batch commands are enclosed into quotation marks. Parameters are
enclosed into &lt;...&gt; angle brackets, optional parameters are enclosed into
[...] square brackets. Omit the quotation marks and the brackets when
specifying actual commands. Separate parameters from the command and each
other with any number of spaces.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are two ways of executing commands:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Single command mode: Execute the Commander one or more times, passing a
single command each time. Specify "/cmd &lt;command&gt; &lt;parameters...&gt;" as a
command line parameter.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Script mode: Execute the Commander once, passing the name of the script
file. Specify "/cmd @&lt;script name&gt;" on the command line, prepending the
name of the script file with the "@" (at) character.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In scripts, you may use one command per line. The maximum length of lines
in script files is 254 characters, all kinds of end-of-line marks (CR, LF,
CR+LF) are permitted. A comment line must start with the "#" (hash mark)
character; these are ignored as well as empty lines.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You can execute commands via both SC.EXE, the loader, and SCMAIN.EXE, the
main executable.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In both modes, you can use environment variables with the syntax of
"%%&lt;environment variable name&gt;%". This block is replaced with the exact value
of the environment variable specified, before processing the command. The
replacement takes place only once, it can't be used recursively.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Below is the list of valid script commands and their syntax. Commands are
case insensitive.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To learn what exactly Commander functions do, read the corresponding page of
the online help. For notes on non-trivial behavior and tricks, see the
examples below.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first group of batch commands contains the main Commander functions that
you can access with the function keys or from the pull-down menu:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"copy &lt;source name&gt; &lt;destination name&gt;": Copy files.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You can also use it to put files into or extract files from image files
and archives. It also works for DOS directories, in which case the
directory and all files and subdirectories in it are copied recursively.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"move &lt;source name&gt; &lt;destination name&gt;": Move or rename files.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the source and the destination are the same image or archive file or
DOS drive then the source files are simply renamed (or moved into another
directory on the same DOS drive). Otherwise, the source files are copied
and then deleted, one by one.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"delete &lt;source name&gt;": Delete files.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It can also delete DOS directories, recursively.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"diskcopy &lt;source name&gt; &lt;destination name&gt;": Copy or convert disks.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Note that you have to specify the image type for both the source and the
destination, a simple file name is not enough.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"makedir &lt;source name&gt; [&lt;label&gt; &lt;integer&gt;]": Make directory.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For directories in 1581 disk images, you have to specify the directory
label and the number of tracks to allocate for the directory.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"makedisk &lt;source name&gt; &lt;label&gt; &lt;disk type&gt; [&lt;boolean&gt; &lt;boolean&gt;]". Make
disk image.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The two optional booleans specify whether an error info block should be
attached and whether the disk should be formatted for GEOS compatibility.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"maketape &lt;source name&gt; &lt;label&gt; &lt;integer&gt;". Make tape image.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The last parameter specifies the number of entries to allocate in the tape
image directory.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"diskedit &lt;source name&gt;". Edit disk.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An interactive function.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"attrib &lt;source name&gt; &lt;attributes&gt;". Change file attributes.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"view &lt;source name&gt;". View file.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An interactive function.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The viewer itself also accepts file names with the common syntax.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"edit &lt;source name&gt;". Edit file.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An interactive function.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The editor itself also accepts file names with the common syntax.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second group of batch commands contains the functions found in the user
menu:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"format &lt;source name&gt; &lt;label&gt;". Format disk or tape.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"validate &lt;source name&gt;". Validate disk or tape.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Don't use it on GEOS disks in Commodore drives!</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"clean &lt;source name&gt;". Clean disk.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Don't use it on disks that contain data in free sectors!</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"safeclean &lt;source name&gt;". Safe clean disk.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Don't use it on disks that contain data in free sectors!</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"protect &lt;source name&gt;". Protect disk.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"unprotect &lt;source name&gt;". Unprotect disk.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"minimize &lt;source name&gt;". Minimize tape.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"usercmd &lt;CBM drive&gt; &lt;string&gt;". User command.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third group consists of special commands:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"list &lt;source name&gt; &lt;list name&gt; &lt;format name&gt;". List the directories of
Commodore disks, image and archive files. "&lt;list name&gt;" is the file used
for the output and "&lt;format name&gt;" is the format specifiation file.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Note that none of the parameters are optional: you can't list onto the
screen and you must always provide a format specification.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For more details on the format specification, see below. If you know Star
List well then you may skip those paragraphs as the Commander uses exactly
the same syntax.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"set &lt;variable&gt; &lt;value&gt;". Assign a value to a variable.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"noinit". Disable automatic initialization of parallel ports, X1541-series
cables and Commodore drives upon startup. If you change transfer-related
configuration settings in a script then start your script with this
command, then assign values to the necessary variables and, finally, tell
the Commander to initialize the ports, cables and drives with the "init"
command.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you leave out "noinit", the ports, cables and drives are initialized
upon startup, according to the settings initially loaded from the setup
file, not those specified in the script, which is processed later.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This command has an effect only as the first command of a script.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"init". Initialize parallel ports, X1541-series cables and Commodore
drives, according to the current values of the configuration settings.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"setdrive &lt;string&gt;". Load the local settings of the specified drive into
the global settings, as in the "Drive setup" function of the interactive
environment.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"exit". Finish batch processing and exit the Commander. The same occurs
when the script file ends.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Parameters are case sensitive unless otherwise noted. DOS path and file
names are always ASCII; Commodore path and file names are either ASCII or
PETSCII, whichever the format of the image or archive, that contains the file,
is based on. PETSCII file names are converted from ASCII, as specified on the
command line, to PETSCII.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Parameter syntax is the following:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&lt;source name&gt;: For DOS files, "&lt;file name&gt;" with the DOS syntax. For files
on Commodore disks, "&lt;CBM drive&gt;&lt;file name&gt;". For files inside image or
archive files, "&lt;image type&gt;:&lt;image name&gt;\[&lt;image path&gt;\]&lt;file name&gt;".</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&lt;destination name&gt;: See the syntax for source files. If you specify a file
name only then all other destination information (image type, image name
and image path) will be inherited from the source.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&lt;image type&gt;: "Disk", "Tape" or "File" for disk, tape or PC64 file images;
"Lynx", "FileZip", "LHA", "Arkive", "TAR" or "ZIP" for Lynx, filepacked
ZipCode, LHA, Arkive, TAR or ZIP archives; "GCRDisk", "DiskZip" or
"SixZip" for GCR-coded disk images, diskpacked or sixpacked ZipCode
archives, respectively.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Case insensitive, ASCII string.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&lt;image name&gt;: File name of image or archive file. A DOS file name, may or
may not include a path.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ASCII string.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&lt;image path&gt;: Path inside image or archive file. If it consists of
multiple components, use backslashes to separate them. When missing, files
are accessed in the root directory of the image. Obviously, this parameter
makes no sense for images that don't support directories; in this case,
the complete image path is silently discarded.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For GEOS-compatible disk images, LHA, TAR and ZIP archives, ASCII string;
for other image and archive formats, PETSCII string.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&lt;file name&gt;: Name of a DOS or Commodore file. When omitted, destination
files inherit the names of their respective source files. You may use
wildcard characters ("?", "*") in both source and destination file names;
for source file names, you may also use the "=" character to specify the
file type.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The "?" and "*" wildcards have the usual DOS behavior under real DOS or
under Windows when long file names are disabled; they behave the Windows
way when long file names are available and enabled; for Commodore files,
their behavior is identical to the Unix standard.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">DOS file names may or may not include a path.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For DOS files, Commodore files inside GEOS-compatible disk images, and
files inside LHA, TAR and ZIP archives, ASCII string; for all other
files, PETSCII string.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&lt;CBM drive&gt;: Commodore drive. "8:", "9:", "0:" and "1:" stand for drives
with the device number 8, 9, 10 and 11, respectively.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ASCII string.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&lt;label&gt;: Label for a disk or tape. For a Commodore disk or a disk image,
16 characters of name, a comma, and 5 characters of ID; for a tape image,
24 characters.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PETSCII string.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&lt;disk type&gt;: Type of the disk image. The values "1541", "1541Ext", "1571"
and "1581" stand for 35-track standard 1541, 40-track extended 1541,
(double-sided) 1571 and 1581 disk images, respectively.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Case insensitive, ASCII string.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&lt;attributes&gt;: File attributes of a DOS or Commodore file.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For DOS files, the following attributes exist: "R" for read-only, "A" for
archive, "H" for hidden and "S" for system. Enable an attribute with the
"+" suffix, disable it with the "-" suffix; omitting the suffix will leave
the attribute as it is.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For Commodore files, the attributes are "W" for write-protected and "C"
for closed. Change the file type with "X" for deleted, "S" for sequential,
"P" for program, "U" for user or "R" for relative.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For DOS files, change the date with "D&lt;date stamp&gt;" and the time with
"T&lt;time stamp&gt;".</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You may stack multiple attributes into a single batch command. If you
change the same attribute to different values in the same command, the
last value will be taken into account.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Case insensitive, ASCII string.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&lt;date stamp&gt;: Date stamp. In either the format specified by the regional
settings of the operating system or the ISO "&lt;year&gt;-&lt;month&gt;-&lt;day&gt;" format.
If the century is omitted from the year, values between 0 and 79 are
assumed to mean years between 2000 and 2079 and 80 to 99 are taken for
1980 to 1999. However, it is highly recommended that you use the century,
too. Also, to make your scripts independent from regional settings, you
might want to use the ISO format.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Case insensitive, ASCII string.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&lt;time stamp&gt;: Time stamp. In either the format specified by the regional
settings of the operating system or the ISO "&lt;hour&gt;[:&lt;minute&gt;:[&lt;second&gt;]]"
format. The hour may either be in 12-hour format, with "a" or "p" appended
to the time stamp, or in 24-hour format. To make your scripts independent
from regional settings, you might want to use the ISO format.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you omit the second, it will be set to zero. If you omit both the
minute and the second, both will be set to zero.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Case insensitive, ASCII string.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&lt;string&gt;: Text string.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&lt;integer&gt;: Non-negative integer number. The "$" (dollar) prefix must be
added to hexadecimal values.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Case insensitive, ASCII string.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&lt;boolean&gt;: Boolean value. "1", "Yes" and "True" mean true; "0", "No",
"False" and an empty/missing string mean false.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Case insensitive, ASCII string.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To specify file names or other strings that contain spaces or other invalid
characters, enclose them into quotation marks. Also, to specify empty strings,
use two quotation marks without anything between them. All quotation marks are
removed from batch commands and their parameters before processing them.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To specify special PETSCII characters in Commodore file and path names, use
"%xy" symbols where "xy" is the hexadecimal PETSCII code of the character.
This means that the "%" (percent) character must always be written as "%25" in
Commodore file names. Also, as all literal quotation marks are removed from
strings, you have to specify them with "%22".</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Variables are, actually, configuration settings. You cannot define your own
variables. Variable names, variable values and index names are all case
insensitive and are similar to those displayed in the interactive environment.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Variables can be of type boolean, integer, enumeration, string or integer
array. The syntax for boolean, integer and string values is described above.
For enumeration variables, the value assigned to them must be chosen from the
list of valid values. For integer arrays, the syntax for an array element is
"&lt;array&gt;[&lt;index&gt;]" (here the [...] square brackets are part of the syntax!),
where &lt;index&gt; is of type enumeration.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the alphabetical list of valid variables, the first part is the variable
name. It is followed by the name of the corresponding configuration setting in
the interactive environment or, if there is none, a short description of the
variable. Then comes the variable type and the range of valid variable and
index values. At the end, you will find comments, if any.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first group of variables reflects the global configuration options:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The following features make the Commander the best of its kind:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is very comfortable to use the well-known Commander-style environment.
There is no need to learn sequences of weird key combinations, only press
some familiar ones. You can always clearly see what's happening on the
screen.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several configuration options allow power users to tune the Commander to
maximum performance.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Commander has built-in support for several archive formats (Arkive,
Lynx, LHA, TAR, ZIP, filepacked ZipCode, diskpacked ZipCode and sixpacked
ZipCode). The external Star Utilities also help you with mass conversion.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The batch processing capability is more powerful than that of any similar
software. For common tasks, you can create scripts and execute those any
time, with as few user interaction as possible.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The disk turbos, for Commodore 1541, 1570, 1571 and 1581 disk drives,
provide an excellent compromise between transfer speed and reliability.
Below are benchmarks of the Commander under real DOS, with default
settings. Serial normal transfer mode is missing from these tables: as the
transfer time is around 8-20 minutes for a full disk, you should avoid it
at all costs!</P>

</UL>

<H3><A NAME="section8">8. Connecting a Commodore drive to your PC</A></H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The serial connection is done using the X1541 interface or its substitutes.
If you only have an EPP or ECP port then you have to substitute the X1541
interface with the XE1541, XM1541 or XA1541 interface.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you already have one of the serial cables mentioned above and want to
achieve a much higher transfer speed and you're willing to modify your 1541,
1570 or 1571 drive and you have a bidirectional parallel port then you can
make use of the XP1541 or XP1571 parallel interface. If you only have a
unidirectional parallel port then the XH1541 or XH1571 hybrid interface gives
you the best performance. You can find the description of all interfaces in
the following section.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Commander was designed to access Commodore drives under real DOS only.
If you wish to do that under a multi-tasking system then you should either use
the XH1541 or XH1571 hybrid cable or the XP1541 or XP1571 parallel cable or,
if having a serial cable only, set the "Async transfer" option to "Auto".
Still, it's not guaranteed to work absolutely error free. Boot real DOS,
remove memory managers, device drivers and other resident softwares, if having
problems.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Commander has a machine independent synchronization method that uses the
hardware system timers. The automatic calibrator inside the Commander tries to
find a delay value that makes your PC communicate with the Commodore drive at
the exact speed of the drive. However, if you encounter transfer problems or
you want to fine tune the transfer speed then you may want to raise or lower
the delay value in the "Transfer options" menu manually.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Commander is equipped with optional fast transfer modes. In turbo mode,
it transfers data from and to the external Commodore drive about 2-3 times
faster and, in warp mode, 5-6 times faster. If you also connect your Commodore
drive with the XH1541 or XH1571 hybrid cable to the PC, using turbo mode, the
data transfer will be 6-12, with warp mode, 6-20 times faster. The XP1541 or
XP1571 parallel cable gives you 6-12 times the original speed in turbo mode
and is 10-20 times faster in warp mode. The Commander has turbo and warp
command routines, as well. These speed up deleting files and validating disks
to 2-10 times the original speed (depending on the number and length of the
files on the disk) and formatting a disk takes only about 12 seconds.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Commander supports the following Commodore drives, including all models
and compatible clones:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1541 drives. 1 MHz; single-sided disks.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1570 drives, in native 1570 mode. 2 MHz; single-sided disks.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1571 drives, in native 1571 mode. 2 MHz; double-sided disks are supported
as well single-sided ones: the Commander autodetects the number of sides

disks.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1581 drives. Disk turbos are continuously being implemented for them. Read
the online history at the SC beta page for more details.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other Commodore drives and CMD drives are not and, most probably, will never
be supported as the author doesn't have any of them.</P>

<H3><A NAME="section9">9. The X1541-series interfaces</A></H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Below are the descriptions of the X1541-series interfaces, with which you
can connect a Commodore drive to your PC to use with the Commander.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you don't want to read through this complete chapter then you should, at
least, read the most important facts about the cables and their compatibility
with parallel ports of different modes.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you'd like to build cables and compatible adaptors yourself then you can
find a more detailed description of them at the cables and adaptors pages. If
you're not good at at soldering then visit The X1541 Shop and buy cheap but
good quality cables and adaptors there.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you're having problems with your cable, you should download XCTest from
the useful external softwares page and test your cable with it.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Serial cables are the following:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The X1541 cable works on older type SPP and PS/2 parallel ports, ones that
have bidirectional control lines. The parallel port on I/O controller
cards for 286, 386 and 486 machines and on Hercules video cards and the
integrated parallel port of most newer 486 motherboards support the X1541
cable but only certain Pentium motherboards have compatible parallel
ports. On motherboards with an integrated parallel port, you have to set
the mode of the parallel port to SPP because the X1541 cable won't work
with EPP and ECP parallel ports. However, on many newer motherboards,
there's absolutely no way to make the X1541 cable work because the control
lines are not bidirectional in any mode of the parallel port. You can test
your parallel port's compatibility with the X1541 cable using X1541Test.
If it proves to be incompatible then you need one of the other serial
cables.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The XE1541 extended cable is a substitution for the X1541 cable. Its
advantage is that works in all modes of all parallel ports. Its drawbacks
are that you need special diodes to build it and that only a few softwares
support it. Please, note that this cable has problems with motherboards
that use the ALI 5 chipset and certain laptops. On these machines, use the
XA1541 active cable instead.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The XM1541 multitask cable differs from the XE1541 extended cable in two
wires swapped at the Commodore end. This enables other transfer softwares
to use interrupts rather than polling for handshake with the external
Commodore drive. Its drawbacks are similar to the XE1541 extended cable.
It's supported by less softwares than the XE1541 extended cable, however,
it works under GNU/Linux, as well.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The XA1541 active cable is similar to the XM1541 multitask cable but it
uses transistors and resistors instead of diodes. This makes it the
ultimate transfer cable because it works with all kinds of parallel ports,
including the ones the XE1541 extended cable and the XM1541 multitask
cable have problems with. Again, it is supported by only a few softwares
and the transistors needed are quite hard to find. This cable also works
under GNU/Linux.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Optional parallel cables are the following:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The XH1541 hybrid cable speeds up communication with a Commodore 1541
drive drive in all modes of all parallel ports. Its advantage is that
sending data to the drive becomes 3 times, receiving data becomes 1.5
times faster. Its disadvantage is that you have to modify your drive
internally so that you can connect this cable to a parallel plug on the
drive. You can't use this cable alone, only together with the X1541 cable.
You can't use this cable together with the other serial cables on the same
port, because of the conflict between the pins used by the two cables on
the PC parallel port.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The XH1571 hybrid cable is a modified version of the XH1541 hybrid cable,
designed for 1570 and 1571 drives. Apart from the periphery chip used in
the Commodore drive, it is the same concept as the XH1541.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The XP1541 parallel cable speeds up communication with a Commodore 1541
drive via a PS/2, EPP or ECP parallel port where the data lines are
bidirectional. Its advantage is that both sending data to and receiving
data from the drive becomes 3 times faster. Its disadvantages are that you
have to modify your drive internally so that you can connect this cable to
a parallel plug on the drive. Also, its need for a bidirectional port
excludes the possibility to use it along with the X1541 cable, except on
PS/2 ports. You can't use this cable alone, only together with one of the
serial cables above.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The XP1571 parallel cable is a modified version of the XP1541 parallel
cable, designed for 1570 and 1571 drives. Apart from the periphery chip
used in the Commodore drive, it is the same concept as the XP1541.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you only have one parallel port but want to use the XH1541 or XH1571
hybrid cable or the XP1541 or XP1571 parallel cable then you can create a
Y-shaped cable. One end plugs into the PC parallel port and the two other ends
plug into the serial and parallel ports on the drive. You can use the X1541
cable together with the XH1541 or XH1571 hybrid cable on an SPP parallel port;
the X1541 cable together with the XP1541 or XP1571 parallel cable on a PS/2
parallel port; and the XE1541 extended, XM1541 multitask or XA1541 active
cable together with the XP1541 or XP1571 parallel cable on a PS/2, EPP or ECP
port. You can't use serial cables other than the X1541 together with the
XH1541 or XH1571 hybrid cable on the same port, because of the conflict
between the pins used by the serial and the hybrid cables on the PC parallel
port.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The mode of your parallel port is a vital feature that determines which
cables you can use with your machine so try to find out all the modes of your
parallel port. Older I/O and parallel port cards only have the unidirectional
SPP mode, most Pentium and newer 486 motherboards have integrated parallel
ports and allow you to set the port mode in the BIOS setup, with the usual
choices of SPP, EPP and ECP.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It's possible that, when changing the mode of the integrated parallel port
in your BIOS setup, you won't find the necessary modes as they are called in
this documentation. Some BIOS setups have different names for the port modes.
"Compatible", "Normal" and "Standard" usually refer to SPP, "Extended"
possibly means PS/2 or EPP and "Enhanced" stands for EPP or ECP. See what the
Commander tells you about the port mode in the "Transfer options" menu.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Below you find some advices about which cables to use with a given parallel
port mode and vice versa. They are based on the assumption that most SPP and
PS/2 parallel ports support the X1541 cable and most EPP and ECP parallel
ports don't. However, because of the lack of strict standards, there are
exceptions to these rules: there exist SPP and PS/2 parallel ports that don't
support the X1541 cable and it's not entirely impossible that certain EPP and
ECP parallel ports do support it. You have to determine the true capabilities
of your parallel port yourself before choosing the cables to use.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you have a unidirectional SPP parallel port then you can use the X1541
cable and, optionally, the XH1541 or XH1571 hybrid cable, for the highest
speed possible on SPP ports. If you have a bidirectional PS/2 parallel port
then you can use any of the cables. For maximum speed, you're advised to use
the X1541 cable and the XP1541 or XP1571 parallel cable together. The X1541
cable doesn't work with most parallel ports in EPP and ECP mode. You will have
to configure them to SPP mode with the BIOS setup software or with jumpers. If
the Commander still doesn't work then you have to use one of the other three
serial cables that substitute the X1541 cable.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The X1541 interface is the easiest of all. You only have to connect certain
pins of the serial port of the Commodore drive and pins of the parallel port
of the PC. You need some plugs, some wires and some soldering skills. The
XE1541 and XM1541 interfaces are not much harder, they only needs some diodes.
However, the XA1541 interface needs a couple of resistors and SMD transistors
which are quite hard to solder. Also, the XH1541, XH1571, XP1541 and XP1571
interfaces are relatively hard to build as you need to do some modifications
inside your Commodore drive. If you're not experienced at soldering then don't
even think about doing them yourself. In addition, the XH1541 and XH1571
interfaces also need some diodes.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The following tables may help you to decide which cables suit your needs
best. Depending on your parallel port hardware, your soldering skills and your
patience, you may choose the cables that will work best for you.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This table is a compatibility chart between different parallel port modes

You can test the compatibility of your parallel port with X1541Test. Also,

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You have to connect the XP1541 and XP1571 interfaces to a PS/2, EPP or ECP
parallel port as on SPP parallel ports the data lines are unidirectional. If
you have a PS/2 parallel port then you can connect the X1541 and XP1541 or the
X1541 and XP1571 interfaces to the same parallel port, using a Y-shaped cable.
If you have an EPP or ECP parallel port then you should use the XE1541, XM1541
or XA1541 interface rather than the X1541 interface. Alternatively, you may
build two separate cables and buy a secondary old SPP parallel port card for
the X1541 interface. The XP1541 interface only works with Commodore 1541
drives and compatible clones. The XP1571 interface only works with Commodore
1570 and 1571 drives and compatible clones.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Please, note that none of the XH1541, XP1541, XH1571, or XP1571 interfaces
is a substitute for the serial cables. You have to connect two cables to the
Commodore drive and the PC at the same time to acquire the enhanced transfer
capabilities. Don't connect the XH1541, XP1541, XH1571 or XP1571 cable alone
to the Commodore drive: none of them contain a GND line so plugging them
without a serial cable may short circuit your machines and, possibly, damage
the periphery chips. Always connect the XH1541, XP1541, XH1571 or XP1571
interface to your Commodore drive and your PC before switching either of them
on and switch both machines off before pulling the cables out.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When soldering the hybrid or parallel cable into your Commodore drive, make
sure that no hardware or software is using the needed periphery chip pins:</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1541 drives, nothing is defined to any of the bits of Port A. You may
solder the XH1541 interface and the XP1541 interface without any problem.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1541C drives, bit 0 of Port A is used for the detection of the head
being over track 1. After stripping this connection off of the chip, you
will have to replace the DOS ROM with that of the 1541 or the 1541-II.
Otherwise you'll get strange results when the drive is seeking: the DOS
tries to rely on the detector line which doesn't exist anymore.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1541-II drives, bit 0 of Port A is grounded. Strip this connection off
of the chip.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1570 and 1571 drives, there are several lines connected to the bits of
Port A of VIA#1. You can't use the 1541 version of the XH1541 interface
and the XP1541 interface with them. However, you may use the XH1571 or
XP1571 interfaces, cables of the same design as the XH1541 and the XP1541
interfaces, with a different chip, namely the CIA, most of whose pins are
unused in these drives.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1581 drives are completely different from the aforementioned members of
the Commodore drive family. You can't use the XH1541, XP1541, XH1571 or
XP1571 interfaces with them. Although there exists a parallel cable for
1581 drives, it is relatively complicated &#150; as it needs an additional chip
soldered into the drive &#150; and, therefore, its usefulness is questionable.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you already have a floppy speeder like Speed DOS or Dolphin DOS in your
1541, 1570 or 1571 drive then you probably have a parallel plug at its rear.
In this case, you have many options of implementing the XH1541, XP1541, XH1571
and XP1571 interface. You may create another cable to connect the drive to the
PC with. You may also split the cable between the drive and the C64 into a
Y-shaped cable, one end plugging into the drive, another into the C64 and the
third one into the PC. In this case, remember not to plug the cable into the
C64 and the PC at the same time. However, your best choice is creating a small
adaptor that imitates the C64 user port on one side and plugs into the PC
parallel port on the other side.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If your 1541 or 1571 drive has no parallel capabilities then you might still
want to create a plug at its rear. This way there will be no cable always
hanging out of the drive. With another cable, you'll be able to use parallel
transfer with the C64, too. Please, note that parallel copy softwares for the
C64 may require some additional connections on the VIA or CIA chip of the
drive. Read their documentation before soldering so that you can connect the
additional pins to the parallel plug, if needed.</P>

<H3><A NAME="section10">10. Technical background information</A></H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are three types of lines on PC parallel ports: data lines are used to
transfer data bytes between the PC and the external device; control lines are
used by the PC to send control signals to the external device; status lines
are used by the external device to send status signals to the PC.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From the PC side, logically, data lines should be used for both input and
output, control lines for output only, and status lines for input only. But
this is not exactly the case. On the early SPP parallel ports (Standard
Parallel Port), data lines can only be used for output; this is called a
unidirectional parallel port. Note that this expression is mainly used for the
usage of the data lines. Furthermore, with a little trick, the control lines
can be used not only for output but for input, as well.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On these early SPP parallel ports, the port pins are connected via open
collectors to the chipset on the I/O controller card: there is a resistor
between 5.0 V and the pin, and a transistor between GND and the pin. The
transistor is controlled by the chipset which, on the other hand, is
controlled by the software. When the corresponding port bit is set to one, the
transistor opens and the resistor pulls the signal level on the pin to high,
a voltage level of between 3.5 V and 4.5 V. When the port bit is cleared to
zero, the transistor closes and pulls the signal level to low, between 0.0 V
and 0.4 V. The reason for the differences of the voltage intervals is that the
transistor can pull stronger than the resistor.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On Commodore drives, the pins of the serial port are also connected via open
collectors to the periphery chip. When there are open collectors on the two
ends of the same wire then three possibilities exist. If both ends pull the
line low then the actual signal level, that can be read by both parties, will
be low. If both ends pull the line high then the result will be a high signal.
However, if one end pulls the line high and the other one pulls it low then,
again, because of the strength of the transistor, the signal level will become
low. The PC or the Commodore machine can pull the line high and low and the
drive will be able to read this signal. However, if the machine pulled the
line high then the drive will also be able to signal back, by pulling the line
low. This is the only way to input data from the drive and this is exactly how
Commodores, with a Commodore serial cable, and PC's, with an X1541-series
cable, work.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is still a mystery why the original parallel port, designed by IBM, is a
unidirectional parallel port. The port wouldn't have been more expensive if it
allowed the software to switch the data lines into input mode. Actually, many
parallel port cards are designed to be bidirectional but are crippled down to
unidirectional mode. The method to enable bidirectional mode on these cards is
described at the end of this section. Such bidirectional SPP ports are often
called BPP (Bidirectional Parallel Port) or PS/2 parallel ports, because they
were first introduced in the IBM PS/2 machine.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, with the introduction of high-speed peripherals, open collectors
started to be replaced by totem poles: there are two transistors, one between
5.0 V and the pin, the other between GND and the pin. The two transistors are
controlled in an inverted way: at a time, exactly one of them is open and the
other is closed. When the port bit is cleared to zero then, as before, the
transistor on the GND side closes and pulls the line low. However, when the
port bit is set to one then it is also a transistor that pulls the line high.
This way, the high signal level is a voltage of very close to 5.0 V, as
opposed to between 2.8 V and 5.0 V in the open collector, and the speed of
switching between signal levels is also significantly higher, allowing more
data to be transferred within a given interval of time.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On most Pentium and newer 486 motherboards, the pins of the integrated
parallel port are connected via totem poles to the chipset. When a totem pole
in the PC pulls the line high then it does that with a transistor. If the
drive tries to pull the line low, to send a signal, then it also does that
with a transistor. The two transistors will be fighting against each other and
the outcome is unknown: the signal level may remain at high, if the transistor
on the PC side is stronger; or become low, if the transistor in the drive is
the stronger one. Most of the time, the transistors in the PC seem to be
stronger and, therefore, no data can be input from the Commodore drive. And it
is not only totem poles that may render transfer softwares unable to work: the
chipset on some motherboards doesn't even contain the circuitry needed to read
the signal level of lines other than the status lines.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The new enhanced parallel ports, EPP (Extended Parallel Port) and ECP
(Enhanced Capability Port) ports, have bidirectional data lines so that data
may be read from a hard disk, CD-ROM drive, scanner etc. connected to the PC.
However, as described above, their control lines are not bidirectional
anymore. Additionally, on some motherboards, control lines are unidirectional
even when the port is switched to SPP mode via the BIOS setup. The X1541 cable
won't work on these parallel ports. If you can't make transfer softwares work
with your motherboard then you should stop testing immediately, because the
fights between transistors put stress on the chips on both sides. You should
rather build one of the other serial cables which are slightly different from
the X1541 cable and work on more parallel ports.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The X1541 cable is of the simplest design. It connects pins of the Commodore
serial port and the PC parallel port without any conversion or wire split. So
that the PC is able to also input data from the Commodore, not only output to
it, it definitely needs the control lines, that it uses, to be bidirectional.
If they are not then the cable doesn't work at all, no matter what software
you're using with it.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The XE1541 cable connects wires, coming from the Commodore end, to two pins
on the parallel port. One of these pins belongs to a control line and there is
a Schottky-diode in front of it. This is the line via which data is sent to
the Commodore. The other pin belongs to a status line which is used to receive
data. Because control lines may be used for output and status lines for input
on any parallel port, this solves the problem with the X1541 cable. When the
PC expects the Commodore to send to data, it sets the control line to a high
level and listens to the signal level on the status line. The diode prevents
current from flowing from the PC end, therefore, the Commodore is free to set
the line to whatever level it wants to. Without the diode, the output lines of
the PC and the Commodore would be fighting with each other, as described
above.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The XM1541 cable has only two wires swapped at the Commodore end. This
results in the DATA line of the Commodore being connected to the ACK line of
the PC parallel port. The ACK line is the only one that is capable of
generating interrupts on the PC. This way, when the PC is waiting for the next
handshake arriving from the Commodore, it can do that by enabling the "ACK
generates interrupt" feature and halting its execution. When the interrupt
occurs, the PC can also continue with the next handshake. Until this happens,
the software uses no CPU time because it's not running at all. Interrupts use
significantly less CPU time than "polling": running in an endless loop that
checks the signal level again and again. Low CPU usage is important for true
multi-tasking systems such as GNU/Linux and Windows NT4/2000/XP/2003.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The XA1541 cable is derived from the XM1541 cable. It also has the two wires
swapped at the Commodore end, therefore, it also improves overall performance
under a multi-tasking system. However, it corrects a problem with the XE1541
and XM1541 cables that occurs with certain parallel ports that are on the edge
of the original IBM specification. According to the specification, the low
level of a line means that the voltage is between 0.0 V and 0.4 V. When a
Schottky-diode is applied onto this line then the voltage may go up to even
0.8 V because the typical voltage rise of such diodes is about 0.4 V.
Unfortunately, this 0.8 V is also just the edge of the low level recognized by
a Commodore. For a Commodore, voltages between 0.0 V and 0.8 V are low; 2.8 V
to 5.0 V are high; 0.8 V to 2.8 V are unknown. In the latter case, it is also
unknown what the software running in the Commodore will see: sometimes a high,
sometimes a low level. It is worth mentioning that exactly this is why
Schottky-diodes were chosen for the XE1541 and XM1541 cables: other diodes
raise the voltage even more.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Instead of diodes, the XA1541 cable uses transistors and resistors. If the
PC needs to pull the signal level to low on the wire then it sends out a high
level on the parallel port. This closes the transistor between the wire and
the ground. Because the transistor is strong, it can pull the signal level to
typically at most 0.2 V which is accepted as a low level by the Commodore, as
well. This voltage depends on the transistor but not on the voltage coming
from the parallel port. Therefore, whatever parallel port you have &#150; including
the ones that are not compatible with the XE1541 and XM1541 cables &#150;, the
resulting voltage will be amplified to an acceptable level by the transistor.
The resistor is used to adjust the working point of the transistor for optimum
performance. Because a transistor will amplify currents, the base current has
to be adjusted to a value that results in the needed output current. If the
input current is too high, the transistor will work slower than it should be
able to; if the input current is too low, the transistor will not switch
reliably.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You may convert a unidirectional SPP parallel port card into a bidirectional
PS/2 port by disconnecting pin 1 of the data latch 74LS374 from ground and
connecting it to one of the output pins on the control latch 74LS174. This pin
may be any of pins 2, 5, 7, 10, 12 or 15 and must not be connected to any
other chip on the board. The corresponding input pin (3, 4, 6, 11, 13 or 14)
must be connected to bit 5 of the data bus. If this is not the case on your
card then you may access this bit from the data latch. Find out which one of
its output pins (2, 5, 6, 9, 12, 15, 16 or 19) is connected to pin 7 of the
parallel port connector and get bit 5 from the corresponding input pin (3, 4,
7, 8, 13, 14, 17 or 18).</P>

including a guide on how to reproduce it. See section "Reporting problems" on
how a proper bug report should look like. However, if you can't access the
external Commodore drive properly, here are some ideas for you.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bare boot your computer, disable all resident softwares, memory managers and
device drivers. Exit multi-tasking systems such as GNU/Linux, OS/2 or Windows
3.x/95/98/ME/NT4/2000/XP/2003. These circumstances may affect the data
transfer. Boot real DOS on your machine or boot your Windows operating system
in DOS mode. Strip everything, you don' t need, off your AUTOEXEC.BAT and
CONFIG.SYS files. You may want to create a boot menu or a boot disk. Note that
you definitely need either the OpenCBM driver or the tweaking package to
access Commodore drives under Windows NT4/2000/XP/2003.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During your test, don't plug anything other than the serial interface into
your PC parallel port and your Commodore drive. From your PC, remove dongles,
parallel port switches and other devices that may filter data transfer via the
parallel port. From your Commodore drive, remove daisy chained other drives,
peripherals and Commodore machines.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the connection with the Commodore drive locks up then switch the drive
off and pull the serial interface out of it. Wait for the error message "Drive
not present", plug the interface back and turn the drive back on. Optionally,
you may reset the drive, e.g. with Control-Alt-Backspace. Then try the
following.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you get completely confused, you may want to simply delete the SC.INI
file and start configuring the Commander again from scratch.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Switch "Transfer mode" to "Warp" in the "Transfer options" menu. This is not
only the fastest transfer mode but the most reliable, as well. If you're
experiencing problems during disk commands then switch "Command exec mode" to
"Warp" in the "Drive options" menu. This will make the Commander use its own,
more stable, software for disk commands.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Raise or lower the delay value in the "Transfer options" menu. It is very
sensitive so change it at steps of one, with a butterfly method: add one to
the original value; subtract one from the original value; add two; subtract
two etc. The highest delay value you can use without transmission problems is
the optimum. You may use the "Recalibrate" button to have the &#150; hopefully best
&#150; delay value calculated for you. If this value works fine for you then set a
value of 0 to always use the automatic calibration rather than using a fixed
value. Note that, if you set a fixed value, you will definitely have to change
it if you started using the Commander under another operating system, e.g.
switched from DOS to Windows or vice versa. The optimal delay value depends on
the effective CPU speed of your PC which, in turn, is affected by the raw CPU
speed, the operating system you use and the current CPU load.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Check, in the "Transfer options" menu, if you have correctly set the type of
the serial cable and the parallel port it is connected to. Do the same with
the parallel cable, in case you have one. If you have no additional cable,
besides the serial cable, then set the parallel cable to "None".</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you really want to access the Commodore drive via a serial cable under a
multi-tasking system then set the "Async transfer" option to "Auto" in the
"Transfer options" menu. Without that, you would most probably experience
frequent lockups or timeouts. For Windows NT4/2000/XP/2003, see the OpenCBM
driver or the tweak package. First, you should test the connection under real
DOS though. You might want to try the async transfer feature under plain DOS,
as well, if you experience transmission problems.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under Windows, open the "Properties" windows of the DOS shell, that the
Commander is running in, go to the "Misc" tab and set "Idle sensitivity" to
"Low", the left end of the slider. This gives more CPU time to the Commander.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Turn "Manual timeouts" on or off. While enabling it usually helps under real
DOS, it may turn things even worse under a multi-tasking system. Also, when it
is enabled, the Commander doesn't really like it if you touch the keyboard or
the mouse during access of the Commodore drive as then the communication will
fall apart.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Check whether the address and mode of your parallel port is detected and
displayed correctly in the "Transfer options" menu. If it is not detected at
all then, in the case of an integrated parallel port, enter the BIOS setup and
check your parallel port settings. On some motherboards, it is possible to set
the parallel port into Auto mode. In this case, a plug-and-play compatible
operating system has the chance to set the parallel port to the address and
mode it likes. However, DOS is not one of these operating systems so set the
address and the mode manually. See the next paragraph for the proper mode.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you have a Pentium or newer 486 motherboard, with an integrated parallel
port and you're using the X1541 interface then change the mode of the parallel
port to SPP or PS/2 (usual aliases are Normal, Standard, Compatible and
Extended). In case you also use the XP1541 or XP1571 parallel cable, you must
set its parallel port to PS/2, EPP or ECP (usual aliases are Extended and
Enhanced) mode. To test your PC against compatibility with the X1541 cable,
download X1541Test from the useful external softwares page. For the other
cables, the parallel port mode usually doesn't matter although there are some
exceptions. You can read more about the compatibility of the cables at the
separate cable info pages, below the cables and adaptors page.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you are still unable to access the Commodore drive then disable the
"Detect port modes" option in the Commander, save the setup and do a hard
reboot with the RESET button of your PC. A very few parallel ports fall into
an unusable state when the Commander attempts to detect their mode.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If a given mode of your parallel port completely fails all trials, you may
try switching it into another mode in the BIOS setup. It is worth mentioning
that, on some motherboards, the Commander locks up the machine completely when
it is trying to detect a parallel port that is in EPP 1.7 mode. This seems to
be some kind of a hardware problem as it also makes GNU/Linux crash completely
upon startup. In this case, you rather have to switch the parallel port into
EPP 1.9 or ECP mode in the BIOS setup.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you have a motherboard for a Pentium-class CPU then you're, most
probably, the owner of an integrated parallel port that is incompatible with
the X1541 cable. To test your PC against compatibility with the X1541 cable,
use X1541Test. Try using an older I/O controller card, a parallel port card or
a Hercules video card with a built-in parallel port. Alternatively, you may
use the XE1541, XM1541 or XA1541 cable instead.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If your motherboard allows overclocking the FSB (Front Side Bus) frequency
then set it back to the default value in your BIOS setup. For the default
value, refer to the motherboard manual. The Commander relies upon the hardware
timers having the same speed on all PC's but changing the FSB frequency may
affect the hardware timer frequency, as well, on some motherboards.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you use the built-in drive of a C128D or an SX64 or you want to use the
same Commodore drive from a Commodore machine and a PC then you must execute a
POKE command on the Commodore machine, every time before accessing the drive.
See the "Connecting a Commodore drive to your PC" section for more details.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Make sure that the serial interface is assembled well, it is shielded
correctly and it is not too long. Check it against the diagrams above or at
the cables and adaptors pages: it may be a mirrored cable or the electronical
parts used in it may be off the specification. If you bought the cable from
someone, you may want to contact the seller with a problem report. You may
also try your cable with other PC's and/or other transfer softwares. If you
want to test your cable, download XCTest from the useful external softwares
page.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Plug your Commodore drive to a Commodore machine to see if it works at all
after all those years. You may want to borrow a tested drive from someone.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you have an integrated parallel port whose connector is not soldered onto
the motherboard but rather has a cable that is plugged onto the motherboard
then check this cable connection. It's possible that the cable of the parallel
port is plugged onto the motherboard in a mirrored way. You may also check its
functionality with a PC printer.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If your network uses parallel port redirection then logout.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you've tried everything and you still can't find out which component is
is not working properly, download XCDetect from the useful external softwares
page. Connect your Commodore drive via the cable to the PC, switch the drive
on and run XCDetect in debug mode, by specifying the "-d" option on the
command line. If the software manages to detect both your cable and your drive
then there's either a Commander configuration problem or you have found a bug
in the Commander. Please, note that if XCDetect displays "(NC:0x83)" or a
similar hexadecimal error code after the device number then it did not detect
a device with that particular device number.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Also, there's a tester software for X1541-series cables called XCTest on the
same page. It allows you to test the cable at a lower level, by letting you
send outgoing signals to the drive via the cable and showing the incoming
reply signals. See its own documentation for more details.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you're done with all these checks and still no luck, contact the author.
See below for more information on how a proper report should look like.
Improper reports will not be replied to!</P>

<H3><A NAME="section12">12. Known problems and limitations</A></H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The following problems and limitations are documented below so, please,
don't bother reporting them:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Symptom: Errors during data transfer sometimes lock up your PC.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reason: Timeouts are not handled and all PC interrupts are disabled while
accessing the Commodore drive.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Solution: Generate a timeout manually by pressing Escape or F10 &#150; if
"Manual timeouts" is enabled &#150; or by unplugging the serial cable from
either the PC or the Commodore drive.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Symptom: Various transfer problems occur under multi-tasking systems.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reason: Accessing Commodore drives under multi-tasking systems is not
supported very well.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Solution: For GNU/Linux, you should be using a native application instead.
For Windows NT4/2000/XP/2003, use the OpenCBM driver or see the tweak
package to make the Commander work under these operating systems. Though,
for best results, you should use real DOS anyway. Please, read the "Usage"
section for more details.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Symptom: Only one of the panels may show a Commodore drive and the disk
turbos don't work if there are more drives connected and switched on.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reason: You can't use more than one Commodore drive at a time. For maximum
speed, the disk turbos also use the ATN line for handshake. If there are
several peripherals on the same serial bus, the other peripherals will
also answer the ATN call, messing the data transfer of the disk turbo.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Solution: Have all needed drives connected but only one of them switched
on. The "Drive setup" function helps you with configuring and switching
among your drives easily.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Symptom: When trying to access certain disks in a 1541 drive &#150; or in a
1570 or 1571 drive that is switched into 1541 emulation mode by setting
the drive type to "157x-&gt;1541" &#150;, the Commander keeps reading the disk
until you take the disk out of the drive.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reason: Because "Extended 1541 disks" is set to "Detect", the Commander
tries to find out whether the disk has 35 or 40 tracks, by reading sector
36;00. However, track 36 of the disk is completely empty and the Commander
falls into an endless loop.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Solution: Set "Extended 1541 disks" to "Never" (35 tracks) or "Always" (40
tracks), depending on the number of tracks on the disk. Alternatively, you
may reformat the disk to 40 tracks (then the Commander will recognize the
disk immediately as having 40 tracks) or "vacuum" track 36 with Disk Demon
on a Commodore machine (then the detection will fail at an instant and the
disk will be recognized as having 35 tracks).</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Symptom: For certain 1571 drives, it may take as long as a full minute to
accept single-sided floppy disks, when the drive type is set to "1571" or
"1570".</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reason: The other side of the floppy disk is completely empty and the 1571
drive can't easily find out whether the disk is single- or double-sided.
This is a bug in older 1571 DOS revisions and has nothing to do with the
Commander, as it also occurs when the drive is connected to a Commodore
machine.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Solution: Format the other side of the floppy disk. After that, the 1571
drive will be able to recognize soon that it's single-sided.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Symptom: After having copied certain disks &#150; either from a disk image to a
Commodore disk or vice versa &#150;, the copy does not work because the
Commodore software does not recognize its own disk.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reason: The software uses sector header ID's to recognize its own disks
but disk images do not contain this information. When building the image
of a virtual Commodore disk internally, emulators such as CCS64 and VICE
copy the "cosmetical" BAM ID &#150; the two bytes at offsets $A2 and $A3 of the
BAM sector, sector 18;00 &#150; into sector header ID's. However, if the BAM ID
is different from the real sector header ID then the software will become
confused. The same occurs if you copy the disk image onto a Commodore disk
and the destination disk contains different sector header ID's than the
software expects.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Solution: When copying a Commodore disk to a disk image, change the BAM ID
to the expected sector header ID afterwards; the "Check BAM ID against
header ID" option in the "Copy disk" dialog box helps you with this. When
copying a disk image to a Commodore disk, check "Format destination disk"
to have the destination Commodore disk preformatted with the BAM ID of the
source disk image.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Note: Other disk-based file formats &#150; GCR-coded disk images, diskpacked
ZipCode archives and sixpacked ZipCode archives &#150; all have separate sector
header ID's so this problem does not arise with them. That is, unless they
were automatically converted from disk images that lack sector header
ID's.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Symptom: GCR-coded disk images, diskpacked ZipCode archives and sixpacked
ZipCode archives can't be written to, apart from creating them by
conversion from another disk-based format.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reason: The structure of these file formats is too complicated for easy
write support.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Solution: You should load such files into an emulator instead and do the
necessary changes there, with native Commodore software. If the emulator
doesn't support a particular disk-based format directly, convert it to
a format that the emulator does support, load that into the emulator, do
the changes and convert the changed files back to the original format.
Make sure that no information, that was present in the original files, is
lost during the conversions, though.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Symptom: You can't copy GEOS files from and to and relative files to
Commodore disks. Also, it is not possible to delete GEOS files on
Commodore disks or to validate GEOS disks.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reason: These features have not been implemented.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Solution: Use the disk copier to copy such files, as part of a disk or
disk image, instead.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Symptom: When copying a GEOS file from a DOS file (in Convert format) into
an image or archive file, the manual file name conversion box offers the
DOS file name, rather than the original Commodore file name inside the
Convert archive.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reason: The dialog box is displayed before the Commander would read any
data from the source file and recognize that it's in Convert format.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Solution: None.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Note: The source and destination files are opened at the very beginning of
the file copy. At this point, no data has been read from the source file
yet so its internal structure is unknown. A possible solution would be to
preread some data from the source file, before opening the destination
file. However, as this also has its own disadvantages, it is currently
under evaluation.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Symptom: In 1581 disk images, it is impossible to enter subdirectories
whose names contain the "/" (slash) character.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reason: Similarly to Unix, the Commander uses the slash character to
separate path components. Therefore, this character is not allowed as part
of file or directory names.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Solution: Rename the directory. If having problems, you may want to use
the disk editor to change the directory name directly on the disk.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Symptom: In LHA archives, files, whose names contain the "/" (slash)
character, are displayed as if they were inside a subdirectory and only
the rightmost end of their name is kept.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reason: Similarly to Unix, the Commander uses the slash character to
separate path components. Therefore, this character is not allowed as part
of file or directory names.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Solution: Extract the files, rename them to a more appropriate name and
then rearchive them into another LHA archive.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Note: Actually, because the original LHA archiver was written for DOS, the
internal path separator of LHA archives is the "\" (backslash) character.
Commodore-based LHA archivers as well as the Commander convert forward
slashes to backslashes, when archiving files, and backslashes to forward
slashes, when extracting files.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Symptom: When reading large directories, you get an error message about
having run out of memory and files are missing from the panel display.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reason: The Commander doesn't show more than 512 directory entries per
panel and there's also a limit on the total length of file names. This is
because of constraints on conventional memory usage.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Solution: Split such DOS directories and image and archive files into
multiple parts.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Symptom: Some very long directories in disk images are not read in
completely.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reason: On 1541 and 1571 disks, the maximum number of directory entries is
144; on 1581 disks, 296. If there are more files on a disk then part of
the directory is outside the directory track, which may only be the result
of manually editing the disk. Although real Commodore drives don't
complain about this, it is non-standard and the Commander doesn't support
it.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Solution: Don't store too many files on Commodore disks.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Symptom: Very long file and path names, those over 254 characters, are
truncated.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reason: An inherent limitation of the Pascal language, in which strings
may not be longer than 255 characters.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Solution: Use shorter file and directory names and not so deep directory
structures.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Symptom: Files, extracted by the Commander or Star LHA from LHA archives,
contain incorrect data.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reason: Instead of the usual "extract" command of LHA, both the Commander
and Star LHA use the "print" command, which only works correctly with LHA
2.14 and newer versions. With older versions of LHA, you will find garbage
in the extracted files.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Solution: Upgrade your copy of LHA for DOS. You can find it at the useful
softwares page. Please, read the "Usage" section for more details.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Note: Actually, there's nothing wrong with older LHA releases. The only
problem is that their "print" command prepends the name of the file to the
uncompressed file data, for each file printed.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Symptom: The Commander complains about the archive being corrupted and
starts printing something, when extracting files from ZIP archives.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reason: Instead of the usual "extract" command of ZIP, the Commander uses
the "console print" command. As PKZIP 2.xx puts garbage into the output
and, actually, sends it to the printer, the Commander supports Info-ZIP
instead.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Solution: Use Info-ZIP instead. You can find it at the useful softwares
page. Please, read the "Usage" section for more details.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Note: As PKZIP is not available free of charge, you shouldn't use it
anyway.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Symptom: The Commander complains about the archive being corrupted, when
extracting files from ZIP archives.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reason: The DPMI server &#150; CWSDPMI &#150;, integrated into the 32-bit DOS
version of Info-ZIP, doesn't like some memory managers and DPMI servers.
The 32-bit Windows version, obviously, runs under 32-bit Windowses only.
It's also possible that there's not enough memory for Info-ZIP.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Solution: Use the 16-bit DOS version of Info-ZIP instead; you can find it
at the useful softwares page. Also, make sure there's enough memory left
for it. Please, read the "Usage" section for more details.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Symptom: Extraction of files, even small ones, from large LHA or ZIP
archives takes a long time and creates a large temporary file, as well.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reason: Because the Commander does not expect the DOS-based external
archivers to be able to handle long file names or file names with spaces
or invalid characters, file names are never passed to archiver softwares.
Upon copying one or more files out of an LHA or ZIP archive, the contents
of the complete archive are extracted, as a single stream, into a
temporary file and then the necessary fragments picked out of it.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Solution: Use relatively small LHA and ZIP archives only.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Symptom: Under Windows, some bytes are lost from the end of blocks, that
contain zero bytes, when pasting them into input lines or into the editor
main window.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reason: The common clipboard of Windows pads text data with zero bytes to
a multiple of 32 bytes.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Solution: None.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Note: Fortunately, this doesn't occur with normal text, only binary data.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The following bugs have been fixed since Version 0.82. For a complete list
of bug fixes since older releases, see HISTORY.TXT.</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Commander doesn't crash dosemu anymore but XMS is not used either.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You get no error message about the drive setup file being corrupted if the
main setup file is missing.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On certain machines, with a buggy VGA BIOS, the Commander displayed an
empty screen, although worked correctly. (Thanks to H&aacute;rsfalvi Levente for
the fix.)</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A weird problem, that caused extremely rare lockups upon launching the
Commander on systems with XMS memory available, has been fixed in the
OverXMS unit.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Fast mouse reset" didn't make any difference with PS/2 mice.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The "Extended 1541 disks" setting was saved incorrectly into the drive
setup file.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The "DOS type" setting was not saved at all into the drive setup file.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The option "Orig format pattern" was always displayed as disabled in the
configuration menu, although enabling or disabling it had the correct
effect.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moving the mouse does not halt the process of a Quick view panel
collecting the number and size of files and directories inside the
directory highlighted in the opposite panel.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When using the "Quick view" item of the "Left" and "Right" menus, it was
the opposite panel that switched to Quick view mode and the display of the
specified panel was emptied.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PETSCII codes $7E, $9E, $DE and $FF were incorrectly displayed with the
lowercase/uppercase C64 charset: the character was reversed.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When pasting long file names, that contain spaces or other invalid
characters, into input lines, they were enclosed into double quotation
marks.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Quotation marks are removed automatically from DOS paths and file names
entered into input lines so that you may copy and paste them between the

reselected.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TAR archives were reported as broken.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The number of sides is not detected for disks in 1570 drives anymore.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For 1571 drives, the Commander now uses the drive's own detection method
to determine whether a disk is single- or double-sided.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When copying files out of LHA and ZIP archives, the archive is temporarily
uncompressed into the destination directory &#150; or, if the destination is a
Commodore drive, the TEMP directory &#150; rather than the source directory,
which may be a read-only medium such as a CD/DVD-ROM or a network drive.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Deleting the last file in Arkive, Lynx and filepacked ZipCode archives
caused data corruption.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Adding files to a filepacked ZipCode archive may have corrupted the last
block of the previously last file in the archive.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The progress indicator counted blocks incorrectly while copying a file
from a Commodore drive in normal transfer mode.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When appending to a DOS file, the progress bar doesn't get filled already
at the beginning of the file copy and, when cancelling the operation, the
destination file gets its original size and date stamp back rather than
getting deleted.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When copying files into filepacked ZipCode archives, sectors filled with
one byte were compressed as "packed" instead of "homogeneous", by both the
Commander or Star Zip, which causes no data corruption but increases the
archive size unnecessarily.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the confirmation dialog box for overwriting read-only or write
protected files, the "No" button has been renamed to "Skip" and it doesn't
cancel the complete file operation anymore.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If "Copy onto dir track" was enabled, when copying a too large file into a
GEOS-formatted disk image, the Commander locked up rather than displaying
an error message about the destination disk having become full.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During file rename, already existing target files are now detected
correctly under operating systems other than real DOS, as well.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you renamed files on Commodore drives with a device number other than
8, the Commander tried to move them instead.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is now possible to rename files inside LHA archives to names longer
than 16 characters.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When trying to create a subdirectory inside a 1581 disk image, an error
message, complaining about the number of tracks, kept popping up forever.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When changing the date and/or time stamps of DOS files, the archive
attribute was always set.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The "Attribute" function could not change the date stamps of files under
Windows XP.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You couldn't change to a completely empty drive, one that had no files or
directories in the root directory.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When reading Commodore disks in warp mode, the complete sector header,
including the two padding bytes, is transferred to the PC and stored into
the destination, if it is a GCR-based disk format.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The warp disk copier handled 20,READ ERROR's incorrectly: no data was read
from the damaged sector and other sectors, on the same track, may have
inherited this error.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The disk copier locked up at the end of merging disk images.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was a memory leak, causing weird behavior or lockups, in the message
box in which the disk copier warned about the sector header ID and the BAM
ID of the source disk being different.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the error info editor of the disk editor, you couldn't put error codes
"A" to "F" to a whole track by pressing the appropriate shifted letter.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When owners are displayed, the BAM editor corrupted the BAM upon saving
changes that affect the second or third BAM sector in 1571 and 1581 disk
images.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the video card returned bogus VESA screen mode numbers, the "Video
mode" function couldn't position the highlight bar onto the line that
represents the current screen mode, upon popping up.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the video card returned bogus VESA screen mode numbers, the Commander,
its loader, the viewer and the editor may have switched the screen into
80x25 mode, thinking that the current screen mode is graphical.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the palette setup screen, the cursor did not show the current color of
the item highlighted in the list.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The external setup locked up upon exiting the "Configuration" menu.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pressing the "Skip" button in the replace confirmation box of the editor
had no effect.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Standard viewers and editors are executed in a way that is more compatible
with DOS clones.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The viewer is now able to show files up to the maximum size of DOS files:
2 Gigabytes.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You couldn't enter subdirectories in 1581 disk images in the file selector
of the internal viewer and editor.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Very long Commodore file names, those of files in subdirectories of disk
images and archive files, were cut improperly to make them fit into the
title bar of the internal viewer and editor.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The directory list of the file selector is now centered on the screen in
VESA modes, too, where the screen is wider.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In disk images, the Star Utilities assume files with a starting track of
zero to be phantom files and don't fall into an infinite loop when trying
to extract file data anymore.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Star List, when using a format specification file, did not display the
container header if the first file entry of the container was deleted and
so not visible; it also did not display the container footer if the
listing ended because of too many entries in the container.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Star List shifted the filenames one line upwards when listing LHA, LHA SFX
and TAR archives without format specification.</P>
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="section15">15. Other changes since the previous release</A></H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since Version 0.81, the name of the personal keyfile has been changed from
"sc.reg" to "sc.key" so that its extension doesn't conflict with that of
Windows registry files. Please, rename your personal keyfile, to make it work
again.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The following features have been implemented since Version 0.82. For a
complete list of changes since older releases, see HISTORY.TXT.</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From now on, for unregistered users, beta versions expire one year after
their release; please, always download the newest beta and don't complain
about problems with old betas!</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The source package does not include the (modified) source of Turbo Vision,
Borland Pascal's user interface, anymore, only the compiled units and
object files plus patch files that convert the original Turbo Vision
source files into their modified form.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Introducing support for accessing Commodore drives via the OpenCBM driver
(cbm4win 0.4.0 or above) under Windows NT4/2000/XP/2003 &#150; use the
"OpenCBM" value for the "Serial cable" option in the "Transfer options"
configuration screen.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Introducing disk turbos for 1581 drives.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Introducing support for ZIP archives, using Info-ZIP as external archiver:
you may read the directory and add, extract, rename and delete files; note
that PKZIP will definitely not work.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Introducing read-only support for diskpacked ZipCode archives: you may
read the directory, extract files and view the disk with the disk editor.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Introducing the enhanced disk copier that can copy between any pairs of
Commodore disks, disk images, diskpacked ZipCode archives and sixpacked
ZipCode archives.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Introducing read-only support for the "*.f64" disk image companion files
created by FCOPY-PC.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Introducing batch processing capability; read the documentation for more
details.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Introducing a Commodore 1541 disk formatter that verifies sectors and
allocates bad ones in the BAM; for non-extended disks only.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Commander is now able to show file and disk sizes up to the maximum
size of NTFS/ext2 files: 8 Exabytes (1 Exabyte = 1 thousand million
Gigabytes).</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Introducing the "/noxms" and "/noems" command line parameters that disable
XMS and EMS usage.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Introducing the "/color", "/bw" and "/laptop" command line parameters to
force the color, black &amp; white and laptop palette.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The "/novesa" command line parameter disables VESA support completely, not
only during startup.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Introducing the "/nowinclip" command line parameter that disables usage of
the common Windows clipboard.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paths longer than 80 characters are also saved inside and between
sessions.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The interval of valid parallel port addresses has been expanded to
$0200-$F800.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under Windows NT4/2000/XP/2003, the quasi-files, assigned to the GiveIO
and UserPort drivers, are kept open during parallel port access and closed
only afterwards so that drivers can set up exclusive port usage for the
Commander.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the parallel port mode cannot be reliably detected under Windows
NT4/2000/XP/2003, the warning about using an XP1541/XP1571 parallel cable
on an SPP parallel port is not displayed anymore.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A new option, "Invalid GCR error", lets you configure what error message
the warp disk copier should generate when it encounters invalid GCR codes
in sectors of Commodore disks.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A new option, "Num of smart retries", enables a different method for
retrying bad sectors on Commodore disks: if the damaged raw data, read
from the disk, is the same for this many consecutive retries, the sector
is considered to be successfully read, the error code is noted but no
error message is displayed.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the "Delay value" option is set to 0, the new default value, then the
actual delay value is computed by the automatic calibrator before every
access of the Commodore drive.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The "Force async transfer" option is now called "Async transfer" and its
"Auto" value allows you to let the Commander automatically decide whether
to use synchronous or asynchronous data transfer.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The new "SafeAll" and "SafeUsed" values for "Detect port modes" skip port
mode detection under Windows NT4/2000/XP/2003, to avoid delays and crashes
of the DOS shell, but work exactly as "All" and "Used" under other
operating systems.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The current transfer mode is highlighted in the "Drive interleaves" frame
of the "Drive options" menu so that you may tune the transfer speed
easily.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More alternative hotkeys: Delete for deleting files, Backspace for
entering the parent directory.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You get an error message if the Commander runs out of memory while reading
the directory into a panel.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Removed the screen flickering upon entering and exiting standard viewers
and editors and, when the Commodore character set enabled, the screen mode
changes upon entering and exiting the internal viewer and editor.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The "low brightness on black" shadow color has been changed to "low
brightness on low brightness" because it casts a more realistic shadow
onto reverse characters.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To specify special PETSCII characters, "%xy" hexadecimal codes may now be
used for source file names, as well.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under Windows NT4/2000/XP/2003, files with the extension ".cmd" are also
considered executable program files.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the Filter settings, TAR archives are taken for PC archives rather than
CBM archives.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The "User command" function of the user menu for Commodore drives always
displays the drive status and displays it as PETSCII string so that all
kinds of unusual drive commands may be used and their results viewed.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When turbo formatting an extended 1541 disk, and "DOS type" is set to
"Dolphin DOS" in "Transfer options", the first padding byte of sector
headers is set to $0D, so that Dolphin DOS also recognizes the disk as
having 40 tracks. The same occurs, when converting an extended 1541 disk
image or diskpacked ZipCode archive to GCR-coded disk image or sixpacked
ZipCode archive format, and "DOS type" is set to "Dolphin DOS" in "Image
options".</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the "File attributes" box for DOS files, the year part of the date
stamp is displayed with four digits, including the century.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In "File attributes", date and time stamps may be specified in the ISO
"yyyy-mm-dd" and "hh:mm:ss" format, too.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the "File info" box for GEOS files, the hour part of date stamp is
always displayed in AM/PM mode, even if the regional settings of the
operating system tell otherwise.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"File info" recognizes more of the standard load addresses of BASIC
programs for various Commodore machines.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Added a separate online help page on disk errors: what their reason is and
how the disk copier reacts to them.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When "DOS type" is set to "Prologic DOS" in "Image options", only extended
disk images get a DOS version code of "P" written into the BAM sector upon
creation; normal disk images don't.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The "Change drive" dialog box does not spin up floppy disk drive(s) under
Windows NT4/2000/XP/2003, during the detection of available drive letters.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The checkbox settings of the "Copy disk" dialog box are remembered during
a single Commander session.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An error message is displayed if, before a disk copy, you try to preformat
a destination 1541 disk for an extended 1541 disk image and "Command exec
mode" is set to "Normal".</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While writing a Commodore disk, 25,WRITE ERROR's are retried as many times
as the value of the "Number of retries" option.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With two new symbols, "!`" and "%`", you may use the extension part of
file names in menu and extension files.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is now possible to toggle the character set even if a dialog box is on
the screen.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the system code page is other than 437 (US default for DOS), there are
seams, rather than national characters, where double and single lines meet
in dialog box frames; also, active options are marked with an "x" instead
of a check mark.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The mouse cursor changes into an icon over screen hot spots and while a
mouse operation is taking place.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mouse wheel up/down acts as Cursor Up/Down, when CuteMouse &#150; or any DOS
Wheel API-compatible mouse driver &#150; is installed.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Middle mouse button clicks on the key bar activate the functions that are
normally accessed with Shift held down.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clicking the middle mouse button outside the active dialog box has the
same effect as pressing Enter.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You can drag the cursor in the command line with the left mouse button
held down.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You can select text in the command line and all input lines with the right
mouse button held down.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You can change the width and height of the panels by dragging the middle
and bottom edges of the panels with the mouse.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You can change the width of the Name columns of panels by dragging the
vertical separator line to their right.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Command line options, except for "/cmd", are also available in the
external setup program, SCSETUP.EXE.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Commander, the internal viewer and editor and Star Lynx all handle the
last file in Lynx archives without errors even if the "offset of last
useful byte in last sector" counter is missing from its directory entry.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The new "PETANSI" view mode of the internal viewer, designed for viewing
ANSI-style PETSCII art, can process some control codes in PETSCII text
files: carriage return, all colors, reverse on/off and character set
switching; other control codes are ignored and not displayed.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The viewer and the editor accept the names of Commodore files inside image
and archive files on the command line, using the common syntax.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When editing menu and extension files with the internal editor, Shift-F1
toggles the mini help at the bottom of the screen.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Star List now recognizes 1571 and 1581 disk images, as well.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now Star List allows you to use field widthes up to 255 characters rather
than only 63.</P>
</UL>

revisions.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Speed up the editor with a line buffer, for slow PC's.</P>

sectors if the file shrinks.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Star Utilities should be able to traverse directory structures.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Low priority changes that may not be implemented at all:</P>
