<H2>The XM1541 multitask cable</H2>
</CENTER>

<H3>Description</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The <B>XM1541 multitask cable</B> is a serial cable that
connects Commodore machines or drives to the PC parallel port. It's a
substitute for the <A HREF="x1541.html">X1541 cable</A> and has been designed
to work in all modes of all parallel ports on all PC motherboards but read the
important notes for exceptions. It's compatible with all parallel ports and
with all Commodore machines and drives and clones that have the usual serial
bus port. It differs from the <A HREF="xe1541.html">XE1541 extended cable</A>
only in a pair of wires swapped.</P>

<H3>Hardware requirements</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You need the following hardware to make use of this
cable:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A PC with a parallel port</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Commodore 64, 128 or VIC20 machine or a Commodore
  1541, 1570, 1571 or 1581 drive, or any other Commodore machine or drive or
  clone that has the usual serial bus port</P>
</UL>

<H3>Software support</H3>

<H3>Important notes</H3>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Don't let the name "XM1541" fool you. This cable works
  with all kinds of Commodore drives that have the usual serial bus port, not
  only Commodore 1541 drives. Also, you can use it to connect a Commodore
  machine to the PC.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If your Commodore 1541, 1570 or 1571 drive is already
  fitted with a <A HREF="cbmpar.html">Commodore parallel cable</A> then you
  might be better off with the <A HREF="xmp1541a.html">XMP1541 adaptor</A>
  which makes use of the parallel cable and triples the transfer speed.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An <A HREF="xem1541a.html">XE/M1541 adaptor</A>
  converts between this cable and an <A HREF="xe1541.html">XE1541 extended
  cable</A>.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have found that this cable fails to work with
  certain motherboards, including ones with the <B>ALI 5</B> chipset and some
  laptops. Check your motherboard's manual or visit the manufacturer's
  homepage before trying this cable. If your PC proves to be incompatible with
  this cable then use the <A HREF="xa1541.html">XA1541 active cable</A>
  instead.</P>
</UL>

<H3>Construction</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You can find the details on how to build this cable at the
<A HREF="xm1541c.html">construction page</A>.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you already have an <A HREF="x1541.html">X1541 cable</A>
then you can find the details on how to transform it at the
<A HREF="xm1541c2.html">construction page</A>.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you already have an <A HREF="xe1541.html">XE1541
extended cable</A> then you can find the details on how to transform it at the
<A HREF="xm1541c3.html">construction page</A>.</P>

<H3>Pictures</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The assembled cable looks like this:
<A HREF="pccbmgenser.jpg">complete cable</A>, <A HREF="xe1541par.jpg">parallel
plug at PC end</A>, <A HREF="cbmgenserdin.jpg">DIN plug at Commodore
end</A>.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These pictures should give you an overall idea on how the
cable looks like and how it should be properly assembled. However, when
building a cable yourself, you should not rely on the pictures only; see the
construction guides instead.</P>

<H3>Usage</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Connect the serial plug into the serial port of your
Commodore drive. Connect the parallel plug into the parallel port of your
PC.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Important!</B> Do not plug or unplug cables while your
equipment is switched on. Make sure that all components of your equipment are
connected to the same, properly grounded power outlet. Put your equipment far
away from monitors, TV sets and other devices with strong emission, otherwise
cables may pick up interference and you may experience data loss or
corruption.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you have problems with your cable then you can test it
with <A HREF="scextprg.html#xctest">XCTest</A> and
<A HREF="scextprg.html#xcdetect">XCDetect</A>.</P>
