<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>The Star Commander</B> is the ultimate DOS shell that
can handle the image file formats of the

(&copy; by <B>Miha Peternel</B>, 1994-1997),
<A HREF="http://www.ccs64.com">CCS64</A> (&copy; by <B>Per H&aring;kan
Sundell</B>, 1996-2009),

Personal C64</A> (&copy; by <B>Wolfgang Lorenz</B>, 1994-1997) and
<A HREF="http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net">VICE</A> (&copy; by the <B>VICE Team</B>,
1993-2012), it copies files and disks between the PC and a Commodore
1541/1570/1571/1581 drive, optionally in turbo mode, and also converts several
popular Commodore archive formats. It is a comfortable, user-friendly and fast
giftware software with online help and is very similar to <B>The Norton
Commander</B> (&copy; by <B>Symantec Inc.</B>, 1986-1995) and
<A HREF="http://vvv.kiev.ua">The Volkov Commander</A> (&copy; by
<B>Vsevolod V. Volkov</B>, 1991-2000).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The latest public release is version <B>0.83</B>, out since
<B>11th January, 2010</B>. You can find The Star Commander on Web sites and
FTP sites in an archive called <B>scXYY.zip</B> (where X.YY is the version
number).</P>

<H3>Important notes</H3>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Download betas for everyday usage!</B> If you're
  having problems with the latest public release, you might want to try the
  latest beta release, as well, as your problem might have already been solved
  in it. Don't worry, most of the time, betas are not as buggy as you might
  first think.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Read the documentation before complaining!</B>
  Before contacting the author about problems with accessing Commodore drives
  and/or transferring files, please, read the "Usage", "Troubleshooting" and
  "Known problems and limitations" sections in the documentation. If you still
  have problems then read the "Reporting problems" section in the
  documentation on how problems should be reported.<BR>
  Unfortunately, the author doesn't have much time for this project anymore,
  and especially few time to answer questions. Therefore, reports about any
  release other than the latest public or beta release, reports covered by the
  documentation and improper reports may be <U>rejected</U>.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>New name for personal keyfiles.</B> Since version
  0.81, the name of the personal keyfile has been changed from <B>sc.reg</B>
  to <B>sc.key</B> so that its extension doesn't conflict with that of Windows
  registry files. Please, rename your personal keyfile, to make it work
  again.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Read beta docs for dosemu and Windows XP.</B> If
  you're running dosemu under GNU/Linux or using Windows XP then download the
  latest beta release and see the "Usage" section of the documentation for
  important information on how to make the Commander access Commodore drives
  in these environments. Windows XP users should also download the updated
  Windows NT/2000/XP tweak package and read the included documentation.</P>

<H3>Known major bugs</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Please, use the latest beta release to overcome the
following problems until the next public release, in which these will be
fixed, becomes available.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Commander is giftware. You may use the unregistered
version as long as you wish and you may give it to any individual, provided
that it's in the original, unmodified archive. It is highly recommended that
you download distribution packages from the homepage or other distribution
sites listed later in this documentation. If you get a package from somewhere
else then make sure that the package has the author's authentic verification
stamped on it.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The unregistered version is in no way crippled, there are
no nag screens or delays in it and &ndash; except for alpha and beta releases
&ndash; it never expires. However, if you are frequently using the Commander
and you are satisfied with it then you are encouraged to register it. Please,
read the file REGISTER.TXT for more details. You must not distribute the
personal keyfile you receive when you register.</P>

software derived from it, you may not ask for money above the normal fee of
the distribution media itself. Furthermore, you may not publish the Commander

distribution media, include it in a software compilation or bundle it with
other software or hardware without prior permission of the author.</P>
