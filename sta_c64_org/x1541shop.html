<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>IMPORTANT! The shop is down and I don't know if it will
ever be up again. If you want to order from me then <A HREF="contact.html">
contact me</A> and I'll see what I can do about it! Note that I have no
X1541-series cables or adaptors anymore; if you want these, please, contact

instead.</B></P>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In <B>The X1541 Shop</B>, you can order X1541-series cables
and all kinds of other cables and adaptors that are mostly related to
transferring data between Commodores and PC's, in case you can't or don't want
to build them yourself. The cables and adaptors are built by <B>Mr. Axel</B>;
everything else is arranged by <B>Joe</B>. The main advantage of this shop
over other similar shops and auctions out there is that everything here is
cheap while still of good quality. This is a shop for the customers, not for
the money.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you haven't bought anything in this shop before then,
please, read this page through carefully so that there will be no problems
with your order on either side.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You can and should order products online because it's very
comfortable for both you and us. The
<A HREF="cgi-bin/xorder.cgi?listself">full source</A> of the online order
script is available free of charge.</P>

<H3><A NAME="conds">Ordering conditions and customer protection</A></H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">According to Consumer International, you shouldn't order
from online shops that don't provide customers detailed enough information on
ordering. Some information about this shop:</P>

<OL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Who exactly we are.</B> We are a few individuals who
  are spending their spare time to help other Commodore enthusiasts, by
  selling Commodore-related products for as low prices as possible.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have been around for several years and sold several
  hundred products already and only a few customers weren't satisfied with
  what they received. If you have any questions or problems then you can
  <A HREF="contact.html">contact the shopkeeper</A> in many ways. It is not a
  problem if you don't know us and, therefore, don't trust us. Ask around in
  forums &ndash; such as UseNet NEWS,
  <A HREF="news:comp.emulators.cbm">comp.emulators.cbm</A> or
  <A HREF="news:comp.sys.cbm">comp.sys.cbm</A> &ndash; about where people think
  such products should be bought. You will be told that we don't rip off
  anyone. We <U>never</U> steal your money. In change, if something goes
  wrong &ndash; which is quite unlikely but still possible &ndash;, please, be
  patient with us.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Site security and personal rights.</B> Sorry, we
  have no secure connection, your personal data is transferred several times
  as plain text during your order. If you don't like this, please, order in
  another shop.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We're logging orders but your personal data is kept
  confidential: no individual, company or authority will get them from us. We
  won't send you any kind of spam (unwanted advertising E-mail) and we won't
  contact you for any reason other than questions or information concerning
  your current order.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Payment methods, actual costs and ordering from
  abroad.</B> Currently, the shopkeeper accepts cash only, in various
  currencies. You send cash entirely at your own risk. If you don't like it,
  please, order at a reseller.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A HREF="paypal_case.html">The PayPal seller protection
  policy is a joke</A>, therefore, we to refuse to accept payments made via
  PayPal, unless the customer has a very good reason to use PayPal rather than
  personal checks or money orders. Please, note that orders, specifying PayPal
  payment without a good reason (we do NOT consider "fast", "comfortable" or
  "secure" a good reason!), will be rejected.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paying on delivery is available for Hungarian customers
  only. People ordering from abroad have to pay in advance. If you don't like
  this, sorry, we cannot help you: you will have to order from another
  shop.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you order online, you will be told the total price of
  your order. This includes all kinds of costs, including: the price of the
  products; postage; bank-related costs. You will have to pay the exact price
  that you are given on the order details page; no hidden extras are
  involved. Non-Hungarian customers pay the same prices as Hungarians, except
  when ordering from a reseller as then you have to pay the bank costs and the
  work of the reseller.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We cannot give you a bill so that you could reimburse tax
  (e.g. VAT/MWS) in your own country. Also, as we send out packages without
  declaring what's inside, customs offices may open them, inspect their
  contents, delay the delivery &ndash; for any amount of time &ndash; and may
  even make you pay taxes and/or customs.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Also, as Hungarian Post is not computerized enough yet,
  we cannot provide you with a tracking number so that you could see where the
  package at a given moment is. If you don't like this, sorry, there's nothing
  we can do about it.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Delivery times and methods.</B> Products are shipped
  via registered mail so that the chances of you getting it are higher; and,
  if you don't get it, after all, we will be able to do something about it.
  The envelope is padded with bubble wrapping inside so that the products
  don't break during the delivery.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Usually, XE1541, XM1541 and XA1541 cables and XAP1541 and
  XEP1541 adaptors are shipped the next day when your money arrives because we
  always have a stock of them. However, if we just ran out of stock or you
  (also) ordered something else then you may have to wait for up to two weeks,
  until a new batch of cables or adaptors you ordered is built. If you don't
  want to wait that much for any reason, please, ask for the availability of
  products <U>before</U> sending the money.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hungarian customers get packages within 1-2 days. Express
  delivery within Europe usually takes 3-5 days; outside Europe 5-10 days. If
  you're in a hurry and need something within a few days, sorry, we won't be
  able to deliver it that quickly. If your package seems to be delayed or
  lost, we won't be able to answer your questions until the maximum delivery
  time (15 days, see below) is over as the shopkeeper's local (Hungarian) post
  office won't answer such questions either.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the maximum delivery time is over, the shopkeeper will
  file a query at his local post office but won't be able to do anything until
  an official answer arrives from the post office. This may take up to several
  weeks or months &ndash; unfortunately, no one can tell. If the package has
  been lost, we will send another package and fetch the price of the original
  package, as a fine, from the post office; if the package has been delayed,
  for any reason, it's not our fault; if the package has been delivered, we
  will refuse to send another package, and it will up to you to find out the
  actual person who picked up the package. As the post office disclaims quite
  a lot of responsibilities (see below), unfortunately, we cannot give you
  guarantees either so, please, wait for your package patiently.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For your information, below are a few facts from an
  official E-mail reply from Hungarian Post's user support:</P>

  <UL>
  <LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>European Union.</B> According to the EU directive,
    within the European Union, 85% of express (so called "priority") letters
    (or packages) must be delivered within 3 weekdays and 97% within 5
    weekdays; non-express letters must be delivered within 4-7 weekdays.</P>

  <LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Other European countries.</B> In Europan countries
    outside the European Union, express letters must be delivered within 3-8
    weekdays, non-express letters within 5-10 weekdays.</P>

  <LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Outside Europe.</B> Outside Europe, express
    letters must be delivered within 5-10 weekdays, non-express letters within
    7-21 weekdays.</P>

  <LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>No guarantee for delivery times.</B> According to
    the Beijing Universal Postal Agreement of 1999, post companies do not take
    responsibility for the delayed delivery of letters as the usual postal
    services are not "time guaranteed". The delivery times above are for the
    customers' information only.</P>

  <LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Delivery check may be requested after 15 days.</B>
    15 days after sending, the sender may order any post office (preferably,
    the one at which the letter was submitted) to search for the letter, by
    filling out a request form. If the post office cannot prove the delivery,
    the letter is considered lost and, upon the sender's claim, the post
    office pays back the postage and the value of the package contents.</P>
  </UL>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fortunately, such delivery problems occur very rarely and
  only a fraction percent of our outgoing packages have disappeared ever.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Guarantee and solving problems.</B> You get one year
  money-back guarantee for the products you order. We test everything we can,
  prior to shipping, but there are products for which we have no real
  equipment, therefore, we can only test it against the circuit diagram.
  Fortunately, there were only a few cases when a product was broken when it
  arrived at the customer.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To decrease costs, we include no instructions with the
  products, If you don't know exactly how to use the products you received
  then read the corresponding info page on this site. Also, read the
  documentation of the software you wish to use the product with. Please, note
  that we are not obliged to provide user support for software other than the
  ones the shopkeeper wrote himself. Rest assured, though, we will try to help
  you whenever we can.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Cancelling orders and returning products.</B> You
  may cancel your order any time &ndash; obviously, before it has been shipped
  to you &ndash;, just send us an E-mail about it.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you received a faulty product then send it back to us
  and you will get a replacement plus cash, in Euros or US Dollars, to cover
  your costs of having sent the products back. However, the replacement will
  <U>not</U> be shipped until the original product arrives so make sure you
  protect your package well enough (padded envelope and registered mail).</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If what you received works properly but you don't like it
  or you ordered the wrong product accidentally then you may send it back to
  us, paying the postage yourself. The product will be replaced with some
  other product(s), if you pay us the difference. If you don't want to swap
  the product for something else, we may decide to give you back the price of
  the product &ndash; minus bank-related costs &ndash; but we are not obliged to
  do so. Rest assured, though, we will try to help you however we can.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Please, <A HREF="contact.html">contact us</A> before
  returning products.</P>
</OL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is additional information on the order details page
and in the E-mails you receive when we confirm the receipt your order, telling
you how to pay, and when we notify you about having shipped the package to
you. By ordering from us, you declare that you have read and understood
everything above.</P>

<H3>Resellers</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The advantage of resellers is that they let you pay via
bank accounts, personal checks, money orders or credit cards for the products
you order, unlike the shopkeeper who currently accepts cash only. This is
certainly more comfortable for you and, also, your payment will arrive at the
local reseller faster than at the shopkeeper. The disadvantage is that prices
are higher, because of the more work involved and the costs of transferring
money from the reseller to the shopkeeper. Current sellers are the following
individuals:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Hungary.</B>
  <A HREF="http://sta.c64.org/x1541shop.html">The X1541 Shop</A>. Run by the
  shopkeeper, <A HREF="contact.html">Joe Forster/STA</A>. Accepts paper money
  cash only, in various currencies. Located in Hungary.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Germany.</B> <A HREF="x1541shop_ger.html">The X1541
  Shop, German section</A>. Accepts bank transfer, in Euros only.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>USA/Canada.</B>
  <A HREF="http://www.nishtek.com/cbits/shop.html">Commodore Bits</A> (see
  Product Group I, Cables/Accessories). Run by
  <A HREF="http://www.nishtek.com/support.html">Burt Bochenek</A>. Accepts
  cash, credit cards (via PayPal; NOT preferred, see conditions above!), money
  orders and checks, in US Dollars only. Canadians may inquire about paying in
  Canadian Dollars. Located in Canada. Also offers Amiga, Commodore and PC
  hardware and software, as well.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although all sellers sell worldwide, it is recommended that
you choose the seller whose accepted payment methods and/or location better
suit your needs.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Please, note that, by default, it is the shopkeeper who
ships the products to you (from Hungary) and the reseller only accepts your
money. However, resellers may also have local stocks piled up so that your
order can arrive within days if the reseller has everything you need. See the
reseller's page or ask him for further details.</P>

<H3>Products</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In each table below, enter the quantity of each product,
you wish to order, in the "Quantity" column.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Choosing products.</B> If you want to order something
but you are not sure what you exactly need or what a product exactly is then
see the info page for each product or visit the <A HREF="cables.html">cables
and adaptors page</A>. If you'd like to use <A HREF="sc.html">The Star
Commander</A> or a similar transfer or server/emulation software then see the
description of <A HREF="xcables.html">the X1541-series interfaces</A>, the
cables that can be used with the Commander and other software.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Product lists.</B> The following tables list all the
products we actually sell. The cables are 1.5 meters (5 feet) long, unless
otherwise noted. We don't want to sell longer cables because, we believe, a
long and complicated cable may pick up unwanted interference, which messes up
data transfer.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Prices.</B> The prices below don't include packaging and
shipping. Also, the Euro and US Dollar prices are for your information only
and are not completely up-to-date. However, the online order script always
calculates correct prices.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you need the <A HREF="cbmsertc.html">"twisted"
  Commodore serial cable</A> then simply make a comment on that in your
  order.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a Y-shaped serial cable that sends data from
  another serial cable (or any other cable that ends in a serial bus plug,
  e.g. an X1541-series serial cable) to two Commodore devices. The two cables
  are 60 centimeters (2 feet) long each.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is almost identical to a serial cable but there is
  a female plug on one of its ends. It extends a serial cable (or any other
  cable that ends in a serial bus plug, e.g. an X1541-series serial cable) by
  another 1.5 meters (5 feet). Please, note that we do <U>not</U> recommend
  using very long cables, including those lenghtened with this extension
  cable, as they can easily pick up interference.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is the <A HREF="cbmparc2.html">method #2</A>
  construction of the parallel cable: a short cable inside the drive, a
  parallel port on the rear of the drive and a long cable that connects this
  parallel port with the user port of the Commodore machine. You have to
  solder the short cable yourself onto the periphery chip in the drive and cut
  a hole on the drive to fit the parallel port into. This package includes
  everything necessary to connect the drive via an additional parallel
  connection to either a Commodore machine, that has a user port, or &ndash;
  using an X1541-series adaptor (see above) &ndash; to a PC. The parts and the
  pin layouts are exactly the same as on the
  <A HREF="cbmparc2.html">construction page</A>.</P>
