<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This program was designed to create Lynx archives out of disk images and
extract them into disk images. The program cannot handle relative files since
I have never seen one. Star Lynx is an external utility of The Star Commander
but is also distributed separately.</P>

<H3><A NAME="section1">1. Usage</A></H3>

<PRE>
   STARLYNX [-]A &lt;filename&gt; [-|/C|D|Y] [&lt;lynxname&gt;] 
STARLYNX [-]L &lt;lynxname&gt; [-|/V]
   STARLYNX [-]X &lt;lynxname&gt; [-|/4|7|8|C|D|X[D|P|S]|Y] [&lt;diskname&gt;] 
</PRE>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Commands:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A: Puts files into Lynx archives. (Add)</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">L: Lists the contents of Lynx archives. (List)</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">X: Extracts the contents of Lynx archives. (eXtract)</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&lt;diskname&gt;:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Type the path and the name of the disk images here (the extension is always
".d64" for 1541, ".d71" for 1571 and ".d81" for 1581 disk images). Leave this
parameter blank to extract the archives into disk images with the same name.
You can use wildcards to add multiple disk images and you can use long
filenames, too.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&lt;lynxname&gt;:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Type the path, the name and the extension of the archives here (the default
extension of Lynx archives is ".lnx"). You may leave it blank and the names of
the archives will be those of the original disk images. You can use wildcards
to list or extract multiple archives and you can use long filenames, too.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Options:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4: Extracts data into 1541 disk images (default).</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">7: Extracts data into 1571 disk images.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">8: Extracts data into 1581 disk images.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">C: Asks for your confirmation about extracting each file.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">D: Deletes successfully processed source files.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">V: Turns verbose listing mode on which means that the creator of the Lynx
archive (determined from the header) is also displayed after the name of
the archive.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">X: Extracts data into 40-track 1541 disk images. You can choose the offset
of the additional BAM entries by adding "S" (Speed DOS, default), "D"
(Dolphin DOS) or "P" (Prologic DOS) to this option.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Y: Assumes "Yes" to all queries, good for running from batch files.</P>
