<CENTER><H2>Star List</H2></CENTER>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This program was designed to list the contents of image files and Commodore
archive files onto the screen or into a text file. Star List is an external
utility of The Star Commander but is also distributed separately.</P>

<H3><A NAME="section1">1. Usage</A></H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">STARLIST &lt;filename&gt; [-|/&lt;options&gt;] [&lt;listname&gt; [&lt;formatname&gt;]]</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&lt;filename&gt;:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Enter the path, the name and the extension of files to be listed. You can
use wildcards to list multiple files and you can use long filenames, too.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&lt;listname&gt;:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Type the path, the name and the extension of the list file here. If the file
already exists, the list will be appended to its contents. If you omit this
parameter then the list is dumped onto the screen.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&lt;formatname&gt;:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Specify the path, the name and the extension of the file that contains the
format specification. When omitted, the contents of image and archive files
are listed in a format similar to the Commodore disk directory list, using the
lowercase/uppercase character set. If you specify a format file, a list file
must also be specified &#150; the output may not go onto the screen.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&lt;options&gt;:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">L: Displays Commodore filenames with the lowercase/uppercase character set
(default).</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">P: Breaks the list up to pages with pauses between so that you can read
what is on the screen. This option does nothing when listing into a text
file.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">S: Lists files in directory structures recursively.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">U: Displays Commodore filenames with the uppercase/graphics character set.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">V: Turns verbose mode on which means that the label of disk and tape
images and the load address of files inside images and uncompressed
archives will also be displayed in the list.</P>
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="section2">2. Format specification</A></H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The format specification file, similarly to the format parameter of the
"printf" instruction in the C language, may contain normal characters, special
characters and field specifiers. Additionally, you can use conditional blocks.
Carriage returns and line feeds are completely ignored throughout the file so
you may wrap your lines anywhere.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Special characters stand for and are replaced by a normal character. They
have the following syntax:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">\&lt;specchar&gt;</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Note that you have to specify "\\" to display the "\" character.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&lt;specchar&gt;:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">$xx: The character having the hexadecimal ASCII code "xx".</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">B: Backspace.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">N: Line feed.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">R: Carriage return.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">S: Space.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">T: Tab.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Field specifiers are replaced by a string taken from the data related to the
current container file &#150; image or archive file &#150; or the current Commodore file
file inside it. When scanning field specifiers, invalid characters &#150; ones not
listed below &#150; are ignored silently. Field specifiers have the following
syntax:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">%[&lt;width&gt;][&lt;flags&gt;]&lt;type&gt;</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Note that you have to specify "%%" or "\$25" to display the "%" character.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&lt;width&gt;:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With these, you can first cut the strings into the width needed and then pad
them with spaces. Don't use numbers, indicated by N, higher than 255. Use
width specifiers in the order they're grouped below &#150; which is not the same as
the order they're applied &#150; and don't use any from the same group twice,
otherwise the result is undefined. The first group of width specifiers is the
following:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">N, +N: The string is padded with spaces from the left to N characters if
it's shorter than that.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">-N: The string is padded with spaces from the right to N characters if
it's shorter than that.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second group of width specifiers is the following:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">/N: The string is cut to its first N characters if it's longer than that.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">/-N: The string is cut to its last N characters if it's longer than that.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">/+N: The first N-1 characters are cut off the string, only the part
starting with the Nth character is kept.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&lt;flags&gt;:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*: Displays the "sum" of the specified type: for "f"/"F", the number of
containers; for "n"/"N", the number of files in the current container; for
"s", the total size of files in blocks in the current container; for "S",
the total size of file in bytes in the current container. Has no effect on
other types.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">G: Uses the GEOS form of types "i", "I", "l", "L", "n"/"N" and "t"/"T".
Has no effect on other types.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">H: Converts "invalid" PETSCII characters &#150; ones that have no exact ASCII
equivalent or are usually not allowed in file names &#150; to hexadecimal codes
in the form of "%xy". Makes sense for types "i", "I", "l", "L" and "n"/"N"
and has no effect on other types.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Q: Encloses the string into quotation marks, before padding it and cutting
it to maximum width.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">U: Uses the uppercase/graphics character set, instead of the default
lowercase/uppercase character set for types "i", "I", "l", "L", "n"/"N"
and "t"/"T". Has no effect on other types.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&lt;type&gt;:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unlike other parts of the format specifier, most types are case-sensitive.
The lowercase version, usually, stands for the default or short form; the
uppercase version for the long form. Types related to containers are the
following:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">b: Number of free blocks in disk images. 0 for other container formats.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">B: Number of free blocks in disk images, including those on the directory
track(s). 0 for other container formats.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">d, D: Drive letter, including the trailing colon.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">e: Short file extension, including leading dot.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">E: Long file extension, including leading dot.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">f: Short file name, excluding extension.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">F: Long file name, excluding extension.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">i: Short, two-character ID code of disk images. Empty for other container
formats.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I: Long, five-character ID code of disk images. Empty for other container
formats.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">l: Container label. For disk images, the ID code is excluded and all
trailing Shift-spaces removed.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">L: Container label. For disk images, the five-character ID code is
included, separated with a comma.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">p: Short absolute path, excluding driver letter but including leading and
trailing backslash.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">P: Long absolute path, excluding driver letter but including leading and
trailing backslash.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">r: Short absolute path, excluding driver letter, leading and trailing
backslash.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">R: Long absolute path, excluding driver letter, leading and trailing
backslash.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Types related to Commodore files inside the containers are the following:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">a: Load address of file, in hexadecimal, with a leading "$" sign. Empty
for phantom files and files inside compressed &#150; LHA, LHA SFX, ARC, ARC SDA
and ZipCode &#150; archives.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A: First track and sector of file, in the form "tt;ss", in disk images.
Empty for other container formats.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">c: Closed/splat flag. Empty for closed, "*" for splat.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">C: Closed/splat flag. 0 for closed, 1 for splat.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">n, N: File name.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">s: File size, in blocks.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">S: File size, in bytes. Displays the maximum possible value for container
formats that store the file size in blocks.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">t, T: File type.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">w: Write-protection flag. Empty for unprotected, "&lt;" for protected.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">W: Write-protection flag. 0 for unprotected, 1 for protected.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Data inside conditional blocks is used for formatting and the resulting text
is output only if a condition is met. You may nest conditional blocks into
each other, thus creating an "and" relation. For an "or" relation, you have to
create two blocks, with different conditions but the same contents. The syntax
of conditional blocks is the following:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">%?&lt;condition&gt;...%?!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Note that the symbol "%?!" ends the innermost conditional block.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&lt;condition&gt;:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">^: Outputs block only when processing the first file of the current
container.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">$: Outputs block only when processing the last file of the current
container.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">H: Outputs block &#150; and only that block, no data outside it &#150; before
processing the first container, for a header. You shouldn't use any field
specifier in this block because no data has been read yet.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">F: Outputs block &#150; and only that block, no data outside it &#150; after having
processed the last container, for a footer. You shouldn't use any field
specifier, except for "%*f", in this block because all data has already
been discarded.</P>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Examples:</P>

<OL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Display an output identical to the Commodore disk directory list, using
the lowercase/uppercase character set:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">%?^\r\nListing %D%P%F%E\r\n<BR>
\r\n<BR>
0 "%-16gl" %gI\r\n%?!<BR>
%-5s%-18gqn%1c%gt%w\r\n<BR>
%?$%b blocks free.\r\n%?!</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Display an output almost identical to the unformatted output, as if no
format specification file were given on the command line:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">%?^\r\nListing: %D%P%F%E ("%gL")\r\n<BR>
Blocks Name Type\r\n<BR>
      ------  ------------------  -----\r\n%?! <BR>
%6s %-18gqn %1c%gt%w\r\n<BR>
      %?$------  ------------------  -----\r\n <BR>
%6*s %4*n files\r\n%?!</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A simple way of including directory lists in HTML, using Netscape-style
hexadecimal codes for invalid characters and appending the number of
files having been listed:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">%?h&lt;HTML&gt;\r\n<BR>
&lt;TITLE&gt;Directory list&lt;/TITLE&gt;\r\n<BR>
&lt;BODY&gt;\r\n%?!<BR>
%?^Directory list of %D%P%F%E&lt;P&gt;\r\n%?!<BR>
&lt;A HREF="file:%D%P%F%E"&gt;%ghn&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\r\n<BR>
%?$&lt;P&gt;\r\n%?!<BR>
%?fListed %*f files.\r\n<BR>
&lt;/BODY&gt;\r\n<BR>
&lt;/HTML&gt;\r\n%?!</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A simple way of creating a CSV file with a header that you can easily
import into a database:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">%?hidrive,ipath,iname,iext,fname,fblk,ftype,fsplat,fprot\r\n%?!<BR>
%/1D,"%/R","%F","%/+2E","%gn",%s,%/1ut,%C,%W\r\n</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another format that can be imported into a database of the same structure
as the previous example, only there's no header and the fields are
separated with Tabs instead of commas:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">%/1D\t%/R\t%F\t%/+2E\t%gn\t%s\t%/1ut\t%C\t%W\r\n</P>
