<H2>The 1541EMU cable</H2>
(type 1, simpler design)
</CENTER>

<H3>Description</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The <B>1541EMU cable</B> connects Commodore machines to the
PC parallel port and, concentrating on file serving purposes, is constructed
for maximum reaction speed on the PC side. It's compatible with all kinds of
parallel ports and with all Commodore machines that have the usual serial bus
port.</P>

<H3>Hardware requirements</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You need the following hardware to make use of this
cable:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A PC with a parallel port</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Commodore 64, 128 or VIC20 machine, or any other
  Commodore machine or clone that has the usual serial bus port</P>
</UL>

<H3>Software support</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The cable is supported by the following PC software:</P>

<H3>Important notes</H3>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This page discusses the type 1 cable, which uses only
  two IC's and, therefore, is easier and cheaper to build. The type 0 cable
  needs significantly more electronical parts but, in change, is
  electronically more compatible with the Commodore serial bus. However,
  practice shows that the type 1 cable is also compatible enough. For the
  description of the type 0 cable, see the
  <A HREF="http://www.kotinet.com/1541/">1541EMU homepage</A> instead.</P>
</UL>

<H3>Construction</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Method 1.</B> If you can't or don't want to put the
electronical parts onto a small board, you may solder them together with
simple wiring. You can find the details on how to build this cable at the
<A HREF="1541emuc.html">construction page</A>.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Method 2.</B> A more reliable and elegant solution is to
put the complete circuitry onto a small board and hide it inside the case of
the parallel plug. You can find the details on how to build the cable, with
this board, at the <A HREF="1541emuc2.html">construction page</A>.</P>

<H3>Pictures</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The assembled cable for Method 1 looks like this:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The assembled cable for Method 2 looks like this:

parallel plug at PC end</A>, <A HREF="1541emuparbot2.jpg">bottom of parallel
plug at PC end</A>, <A HREF="1541emupwrgam.jpg">game port plug at PC end</A>,
<A HREF="cbmgenserdin.jpg">DIN plug at Commodore end</A>.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These pictures should give you an overall idea on how the
cable looks like and how it should be properly assembled. However, when
building a cable yourself, you should not rely on the pictures only; see the
construction guide instead.</P>

<H3>Usage</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Connect the serial plug into the serial port of your
Commodore machine. Connect the game port plug into the game port of your PC.
Connect the parallel plug into the parallel port of your PC.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Important!</B> Do not plug or unplug cables while your
equipment is switched on. Make sure that all components of your equipment are
connected to the same, properly grounded power outlet. Put your equipment far
away from monitors, TV sets and other devices with strong emission, otherwise
cables may pick up interference and you may experience data loss or
corruption.</P>
