<H2>The XP1541 and XP1571 parallel cables</H2>
</CENTER>

<H3>Description</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The <B>XP1541 parallel cable</B> and the <B>XP1571 parallel
cable</B> are companion cables for the <A HREF="x1541.html">X1541 cable</A>,
the <A HREF="xe1541.html">XE1541 extended cable</A>, the
<A HREF="xm1541.html">XM1541 multitask cable</A> and the
<A HREF="xa1541.html">XA1541 active cable</A>, to get the most possible out of
<A HREF="parport.html">PS/2</A>, <A HREF="parport.html">EPP</A> and
<A HREF="parport.html">ECP</A> ports, creating an additional parallel
connection between a Commodore 1541, 1570 or 1571 drive and the PC parallel
port. This parallel connection speeds up both transfer directions to about
triple speed (the actual value depends on the transfer software, as well).
They are compatible with PS/2, EPP and ECP parallel ports and come in two
flavors: the XP1541 parallel cable for 1541 drives and the XP1571 parallel
cable for 1570 and 1571 drives.</P>

<H3>Important notes</H3>

<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Don't let the name "XP1571" fool you. This cable flavor
  also works with Commodore 1570 drives, not only Commodore 1571 drives. The
  other "XP1541" flavor is for Commodore 1541 drives only.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This cable needs modifications in your Commodore drive.
  If you're not good at hardware hacking, don't try doing it yourself but ask
  for an expert's help instead.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This cable is rather a concept than an actual cable.
  If you build it as described in methods #1 and #2, you will be able to use
  the parallel capabilities of your Commodore drive only from a PC, but not
  from a Commodore machine. Method #3 is solves this problem but you would
  still need two parallel ports &ndash; one for the serial cable and one for
  this cable &ndash;, unless you build one of the
  <A HREF="xcables.html#combo">X1541-series cable combos</A> instead.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Your best choice is method #4, which implements the
  concept as a <A HREF="cbmpar.html">Commodore parallel cable</A> plugged into
  an <A HREF="xcables.html#combo">X1541-series adaptor</A>. This way, the
  drive can be connected to a Commodore machine, via the Commodore parallel
  cable alone, as well as to a PC, via the cable plugged into the adaptor
  which needs only one parallel port.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the recommended implementation of this cable
  is a Commodore parallel cable and an X1541-series adaptor, this cable does
  not connect the hardware handshake lines (PC2 and FLAG2) of the Commodore
  parallel cable to any pin on the PC parallel port. As the software emulation
  of hardware handshake is quite impossible on a PC, software handshake is
  used on the accompanying X1541-series serial cable instead.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This cable is a companion, it doesn't work alone. On a
  <A HREF="parport.html">PS/2</A> port, you can use it along with any of the
  four serial cables; on an <A HREF="parport.html">EPP</A> or
  <A HREF="parport.html">ECP</A> port, the <A HREF="x1541.html">X1541
  cable</A> is ruled out becuase it doesn't work on such ports.</P>

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This cable contains no GND connection because the
  serial cable already has one. Multiple GND connections may result in a
  "ground loop", when current is flowing between the two machines via the GND
  lines. This can cause not only unreliable behavior but also damage to your
  equipment. It may be possible to filter the GND lines so that they fulfill
  their primary purpose but not create a ground loop, however, such solutions
  may be relatively complicated and expensive.</P>
</UL>

<H3>Construction</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are several methods to build this cable. You may
share the parallel port between this cable and any of the four serial cables
&ndash; <A HREF="x1541.html">X1541 cable</A>, <A HREF="xe1541.html">XE1541
extended cable</A>, <A HREF="xm1541.html">XM1541 multitask cable</A> or
<A HREF="xa1541.html">XA1541 active cable</A> &ndash; by building a Y-shaped
cable and soldering the extra connections of this cable onto the parallel port
plug you already have. See the <A HREF="xep1541.html">XEP1541 cable combo</A>,
the <A HREF="xmp1541.html">XMP1541 cable combo</A> or the
<A HREF="xap1541.html">XAP1541 cable combo</A> for more details.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Method 1.</B> Your drive has no parallel capabilities
yet and you want to connect the cable directly onto the periphery chip in the
drive. If possible, you shouldn't use this method because, this way, you won't
be able to make use of it with a Commodore machine. You can find the details
on how to build this cable at the <A HREF="xp1541c.html">construction page for
1541 drives</A> and the <A HREF="xp1571c.html">construction page for 1570 and
1571 drives</A>.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Method 2.</B> Your drive has no parallel capabilities
yet and you want to create a parallel port on your drive and then connect the
cable to it. This is the preferred method because you can also make use of it
with a Commodore machine. You can find the details on how to build this cable
at the <A HREF="xp1541c2.html">construction page</A>.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you have successfully finished the parallel port on your
drive then you can also build the <A HREF="cbmpar.html">Commodore parallel
cable</A>, to use the parallel capabilities with a Commodore machine.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Method 3.</B> Your drive already has a
<A HREF="cbmpar.html">Commodore parallel cable</A> and you want to make use of
it. In this case, you'll have to build an adaptor, through which you can
connect the cable to the PC parallel port. You can find the details on how to
build this adaptor at the <A HREF="xp1541ac.html">construction page</A>.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Method 4.</B> The <A HREF="xep1541a.html">XEP1541
adaptor</A>, besides serving as an <A HREF="xe1541.html">XE1541 extended
cable</A>, adapts a <A HREF="cbmpar.html">Commodore parallel cable</A> for use
with a PC. So do the <A HREF="xmp1541a.html">XMP1541 adaptor</A> and the
<A HREF="xap1541a.html">XAP1541 adaptor</A>.</P>

<H3>Usage</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you built a cable and you created or already have a
parallel port on your Commodore drive then you can connect one end of the
cable into it; otherwise the cable is, probably, just hanging out of the
drive. If you built an adaptor then connect the user port plug onto it, being
very careful to exactly do it upside down, that is, the top side of the user
port plug should be leveled with that side of the adaptor without circuitry.
In any case, connect the parallel plug of your cable or adaptor into the
parallel port of your PC.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Important!</B> Do not plug or unplug cables while your
equipment is switched on. Make sure that all components of your equipment are
connected to the same, properly grounded power outlet. Put your equipment far
away from monitors, TV sets and other devices with strong emission, otherwise
cables may pick up interference and you may experience data loss or
corruption. Never leave this cable connected alone, only if the serial cable
is also connected, otherwise the lack of GND connection may severely damage
your equipment.</P>
